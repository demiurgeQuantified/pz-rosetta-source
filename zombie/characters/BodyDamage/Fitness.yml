            notes: 'We setup a timer after finishing an exercice, 12h after, we gonna
              start to increase stiffness (add pains in muscles)  When adding the
              stiffness, we decrease slowly our vars while increasing pain, untill
              no more stiffness is to be added.  Stiffness induced will depend on
              regularity, fatigue.  Numbers approx: At 0 regularity, 60min exercises
              should gives almost 4h of stiffness (gets additional pain)'
