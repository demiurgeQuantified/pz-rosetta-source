            notes: Returns TRUE if this variable slot can accept and/or convert the
              supplied value object.  Returns FALSE if the conversion would result
              in a loss of data.    Eg. If a String is given to a Float variable,
              and the string is not of a numeric format, then the string value       would
              be lost.
