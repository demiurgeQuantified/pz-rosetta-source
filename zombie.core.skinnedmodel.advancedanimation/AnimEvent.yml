          notes: class AnimEvent   Used to set a game variable from an animation node.     eg.
            Set a sword's collision box to Active during a swing animation,     then
            Inactive once swing is done.     Holds a time, name, and value     The
            time is measured as a fraction of the animation's time.     This means
            that scaling an animation's speed scales the Events as well.
