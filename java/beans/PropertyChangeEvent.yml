          notes: "A \"PropertyChange\" event gets delivered whenever a bean changes\
            \ a \"bound\"\n or \"constrained\" property.  A PropertyChangeEvent object\
            \ is sent as an\n argument to the PropertyChangeListener and VetoableChangeListener\
            \ methods.\n \n Normally PropertyChangeEvents are accompanied by the name\
            \ and the old\n and new value of the changed property.  If the new value\
            \ is a primitive\n type (such as int or boolean) it must be wrapped as\
            \ the\n corresponding java.lang.* Object type (such as Integer or Boolean).\n\
            \ \n Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their\n\
            \ true values are not known.\n \n An event source may send a null object\
            \ as the name to indicate that an\n arbitrary set of if its properties\
            \ have changed.  In this case the\n old and new values should also be\
            \ null."
