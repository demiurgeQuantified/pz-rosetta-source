          notes: "This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support constrained\n\
            \ properties.  It manages a list of listeners and dispatches\n PropertyChangeEvents\
            \ to them.  You can use an instance of this class\n as a member field\
            \ of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.\n The VetoableChangeListener\
            \ can be registered for all properties\n or for a property specified by\
            \ name.\n \n Here is an example of VetoableChangeSupport usage that follows\n\
            \ the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeans specification:\n\
            \ <code>\n public class MyBean {\n     private final VetoableChangeSupport\
            \ vcs = new VetoableChangeSupport(this);\n\n     public void addVetoableChangeListener(VetoableChangeListener\
            \ listener) {\n         this.vcs.addVetoableChangeListener(listener);\n\
            \     }\n\n     public void removeVetoableChangeListener(VetoableChangeListener\
            \ listener) {\n         this.vcs.removeVetoableChangeListener(listener);\n\
            \     }\n\n     private String value;\n\n     public String getValue()\
            \ {\n         return this.value;\n     }\n\n     public void setValue(String\
            \ newValue) throws PropertyVetoException {\n         String oldValue =\
            \ this.value;\n         this.vcs.fireVetoableChange(\"value\", oldValue,\
            \ newValue);\n         this.value = newValue;\n     }\n\n     [...]\n\
            \ }\n </code>\n \n A VetoableChangeSupport instance is thread-safe.\n\
            \ \n This class is serializable.  When it is serialized it will save\n\
            \ (and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable.  Any\n\
            \ non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization."
