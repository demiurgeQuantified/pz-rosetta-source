          notes: "The BasicPermission class extends the Permission class, and\n can\
            \ be used as the base class for permissions that want to\n follow the\
            \ same naming convention as BasicPermission.\n \n The name for a BasicPermission\
            \ is the name of the given permission\n (for example, \"exit\",\n \"setFactory\"\
            , \"print.queueJob\", etc). The naming\n convention follows the  hierarchical\
            \ property naming convention.\n An asterisk may appear by itself, or if\
            \ immediately preceded by a \".\"\n may appear at the end of the name,\
            \ to signify a wildcard match.\n For example, \"*\" and \"java.*\" signify\
            \ a wildcard match, while \"*java\", \"a*b\",\n and \"java*\" do not.\n\
            \ \n The action string (inherited from Permission) is unused.\n Thus,\
            \ BasicPermission is commonly used as the base class for\n \"named\" permissions\n\
            \ (ones that contain a name but no actions list; you either have the\n\
            \ named permission or you don't.)\n Subclasses may implement actions on\
            \ top of BasicPermission,\n if desired."
