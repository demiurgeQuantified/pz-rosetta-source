          notes: "The ProtectionDomain class encapsulates the characteristics of a\
            \ domain,\n which encloses a set of classes whose instances are granted\
            \ a set\n of permissions when being executed on behalf of a given set\
            \ of Principals.\n \n A static set of permissions can be bound to a ProtectionDomain\
            \ when it is\n constructed; such permissions are granted to the domain\
            \ regardless of the\n Policy in force. However, to support dynamic security\
            \ policies, a\n ProtectionDomain can also be constructed such that it\
            \ is dynamically\n mapped to a set of permissions by the current Policy\
            \ whenever a permission\n is checked."
