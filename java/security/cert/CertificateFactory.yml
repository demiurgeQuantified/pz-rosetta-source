          notes: "This class defines the functionality of a certificate factory, which\
            \ is\n used to generate certificate, certification path (CertPath)\n and\
            \ certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from their encodings.\n\n\
            \ For encodings consisting of multiple certificates, use\n generateCertificates\
            \ when you want to\n parse a collection of possibly unrelated certificates.\
            \ Otherwise,\n use generateCertPath when you want to generate\n a CertPath\
            \ (a certificate chain) and subsequently\n validate it with a CertPathValidator.\n\
            \n A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an\n\
            \ instance of java.security.cert.X509Certificate, and CRLs\n that are\
            \ an instance of java.security.cert.X509CRL.\n\n The following example\
            \ reads a file with Base64 encoded certificates,\n which are each bounded\
            \ at the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and\n bounded at the\
            \ end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----. We convert the\n FileInputStream (which\
            \ does not support mark\n and reset) to a BufferedInputStream (which\n\
            \ supports those methods), so that each call to\n generateCertificate\
            \ consumes only one certificate, and the\n read position of the input\
            \ stream is positioned to the next certificate in\n the file:\n\n <code>\n\
            \ FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);\n BufferedInputStream\
            \ bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);\n\n CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance(\"\
            X.509\");\n\n while (bis.available() > 0) {\n    Certificate cert = cf.generateCertificate(bis);\n\
            \    System.out.println(cert.toString());\n }\n </code>\n\n The following\
            \ example parses a PKCS#7-formatted certificate reply stored\n in a file\
            \ and extracts all the certificates from it:\n\n \n FileInputStream fis\
            \ = new FileInputStream(filename);\n CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance(\"\
            X.509\");\n Collection c = cf.generateCertificates(fis);\n Iterator i\
            \ = c.iterator();\n while (i.hasNext()) {\n    Certificate cert = (Certificate)i.next();\n\
            \    System.out.println(cert);\n }\n \n\n  Every implementation of the\
            \ Java platform is required to support the\n following standard CertificateFactory\
            \ type:\n \n X.509\n \n and the following standard CertPath encodings:\n\
            \ \n PKCS7\n PkiPath\n \n The type and encodings are described in the\
            \ \n CertificateFactory section and the \n CertPath Encodings section\
            \ of the\n Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.\n Consult\
            \ the release documentation for your implementation to see if any\n other\
            \ types or encodings are supported."
