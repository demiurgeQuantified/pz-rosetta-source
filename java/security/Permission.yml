          notes: "Abstract class for representing access to a system resource.\n All\
            \ permissions have a name (whose interpretation depends on the subclass),\n\
            \ as well as abstract functions for defining the semantics of the\n particular\
            \ Permission subclass.\n\n Most Permission objects also include an \"\
            actions\" list that tells the actions\n that are permitted for the object.\
            \  For example,\n for a java.io.FilePermission object, the permission\
            \ name is\n the pathname of a file (or directory), and the actions list\n\
            \ (such as \"read, write\") specifies which actions are granted for the\n\
            \ specified file (or for files in the specified directory).\n The actions\
            \ list is optional for Permission objects, such as\n java.lang.RuntimePermission,\n\
            \ that don't need such a list; you either have the named permission (such\n\
            \ as \"system.exit\") or you don't.\n\n An important method that must\
            \ be implemented by each subclass is\n the implies method to compare Permissions.\
            \ Basically,\n \"permission p1 implies permission p2\" means that\n if\
            \ one is granted permission p1, one is naturally granted permission p2.\n\
            \ Thus, this is not an equality test, but rather more of a\n subset test.\n\
            \n  Permission objects are similar to String objects in that they\n are\
            \ immutable once they have been created. Subclasses should not\n provide\
            \ methods that can change the state of a permission\n once it has been\
            \ created."
