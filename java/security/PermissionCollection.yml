          notes: "Abstract class representing a collection of Permission objects.\n\
            \n With a PermissionCollection, you can:\n \n  add a permission to the\
            \ collection using the add method.\n  check to see if a particular permission\
            \ is implied in the\n      collection, using the implies method.\n  enumerate\
            \ all the permissions, using the elements method.\n \n\n When it is desirable\
            \ to group together a number of Permission objects\n of the same type,\
            \ the newPermissionCollection method on that\n particular type of Permission\
            \ object should first be called. The default\n behavior (from the Permission\
            \ class) is to simply return null.\n Subclasses of class Permission override\
            \ the method if they need to store\n their permissions in a particular\
            \ PermissionCollection object in order\n to provide the correct semantics\
            \ when the\n PermissionCollection.implies method is called.\n If a non-null\
            \ value is returned, that PermissionCollection must be used.\n If null\
            \ is returned, then the caller of newPermissionCollection\n is free to\
            \ store permissions of the\n given type in any PermissionCollection they\
            \ choose\n (one that uses a Hashtable, one that uses a Vector, etc).\n\
            \n The PermissionCollection returned by the\n Permission.newPermissionCollection\n\
            \ method is a homogeneous collection, which stores only Permission objects\n\
            \ for a given Permission type.  A PermissionCollection may also be\n heterogeneous.\
            \  For example, Permissions is a PermissionCollection\n subclass that\
            \ represents a collection of PermissionCollections.\n That is, its members\
            \ are each a homogeneous PermissionCollection.\n For example, a Permissions\
            \ object might have a FilePermissionCollection\n for all the FilePermission\
            \ objects, a SocketPermissionCollection for all the\n SocketPermission\
            \ objects, and so on. Its add method adds a\n permission to the appropriate\
            \ collection.\n\n Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection\n\
            \ such as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain\
            \ a\n PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the\n PermissionCollection\
            \ should call\n the newPermissionCollection method on the permission's\
            \ class\n to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection. If\n newPermissionCollection\n\
            \ returns null, the PermissionCollection\n is free to store the permission\
            \ in any type of PermissionCollection it\n desires (one using a Hashtable,\
            \ one using a Vector, etc.). For example,\n the Permissions object uses\
            \ a default PermissionCollection implementation\n that stores the permission\
            \ objects in a Hashtable.\n\n  Subclass implementations of PermissionCollection\
            \ should assume\n that they may be called simultaneously from multiple\
            \ threads,\n and therefore should be synchronized properly.  Furthermore,\n\
            \ Enumerations returned via the elements method are\n not fail-fast. \
            \ Modifications to a collection should not be\n performed while enumerating\
            \ over that collection."
