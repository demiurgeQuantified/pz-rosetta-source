          notes: "A Rectangle specifies an area in a coordinate space that is\n enclosed\
            \ by the Rectangle object's upper-left point\n (x,y)\n in the coordinate\
            \ space, its width, and its height.\n \n A Rectangle object's width and\n\
            \ height are public fields. The constructors\n that create a Rectangle,\
            \ and the methods that can modify\n one, do not prevent setting a negative\
            \ value for width or height.\n \n \n A Rectangle whose width or height\
            \ is exactly zero has location\n along those axes with zero dimension,\
            \ but is otherwise considered empty.\n The isEmpty() method will return\
            \ true for such a Rectangle.\n Methods which test if an empty Rectangle\
            \ contains or intersects\n a point or rectangle will always return false\
            \ if either dimension is zero.\n Methods which combine such a Rectangle\
            \ with a point or rectangle\n will include the location of the Rectangle\
            \ on that axis in the\n result as if the add(Point) method were being\
            \ called.\n \n \n A Rectangle whose width or height is negative has neither\n\
            \ location nor dimension along those axes with negative dimensions.\n\
            \ Such a Rectangle is treated as non-existent along those axes.\n Such\
            \ a Rectangle is also empty with respect to containment\n calculations\
            \ and methods which test if it contains or intersects a\n point or rectangle\
            \ will always return false.\n Methods which combine such a Rectangle with\
            \ a point or rectangle\n will ignore the Rectangle entirely in generating\
            \ the result.\n If two Rectangle objects are combined and each has a negative\n\
            \ dimension, the result will have at least one negative dimension.\n \n\
            \ \n Methods which affect only the location of a Rectangle will\n operate\
            \ on its location regardless of whether or not it has a negative\n or\
            \ zero dimension along either axis.\n \n Note that a Rectangle constructed\
            \ with the default no-argument\n constructor will have dimensions of 0x0\
            \ and therefore be empty.\n That Rectangle will still have a location\
            \ of (0,0) and\n will contribute that location to the union and add operations.\n\
            \ Code attempting to accumulate the bounds of a set of points should\n\
            \ therefore initially construct the Rectangle with a specifically\n negative\
            \ width and height or it should use the first point in the set\n to construct\
            \ the Rectangle.\n For example:\n <code>\n     Rectangle bounds = new\
            \ Rectangle(0, 0, -1, -1);\n     for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++)\
            \ {\n         bounds.add(points[i]);\n     }\n </code>\n or if we know\
            \ that the points array contains at least one point:\n <code>\n     Rectangle\
            \ bounds = new Rectangle(points[0]);\n     for (int i = 1; i < points.length;\
            \ i++) {\n         bounds.add(points[i]);\n     }\n </code>\n \n This\
            \ class uses 32-bit integers to store its location and dimensions.\n Frequently\
            \ operations may produce a result that exceeds the range of\n a 32-bit\
            \ integer.\n The methods will calculate their results in a way that avoids\
            \ any\n 32-bit overflow for intermediate results and then choose the best\n\
            \ representation to store the final results back into the 32-bit fields\n\
            \ which hold the location and dimensions.\n The location of the result\
            \ will be stored into the x and\n y fields by clipping the true result\
            \ to the nearest 32-bit value.\n The values stored into the width and\
            \ height dimension\n fields will be chosen as the 32-bit values that encompass\
            \ the largest\n part of the true result as possible.\n Generally this\
            \ means that the dimension will be clipped independently\n to the range\
            \ of 32-bit integers except that if the location had to be\n moved to\
            \ store it into its pair of 32-bit fields then the dimensions\n will be\
            \ adjusted relative to the \"best representation\" of the location.\n\
            \ If the true result had a negative dimension and was therefore\n non-existent\
            \ along one or both axes, the stored dimensions will be\n negative numbers\
            \ in those axes.\n If the true result had a location that could be represented\
            \ within\n the range of 32-bit integers, but zero dimension along one\
            \ or both\n axes, then the stored dimensions will be zero in those axes."
