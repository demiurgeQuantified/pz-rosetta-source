          notes: "A class that implements a menu which can be dynamically popped up\n\
            \ at a specified position within a component.\n \n As the inheritance\
            \ hierarchy implies, a PopupMenu\n  can be used anywhere a Menu can be\
            \ used.\n However, if you use a PopupMenu like a Menu\n (e.g., you add\
            \ it to a MenuBar), then you cannot\n call show on that PopupMenu."
