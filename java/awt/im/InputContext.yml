          notes: "Provides methods to control text input facilities such as input\n\
            \ methods and keyboard layouts.\n Two methods handle both input methods\
            \ and keyboard layouts: selectInputMethod\n lets a client component select\
            \ an input method or keyboard layout by locale,\n getLocale lets a client\
            \ component obtain the locale of the current input method\n or keyboard\
            \ layout.\n The other methods more specifically support interaction with\
            \ input methods:\n They let client components control the behavior of\
            \ input methods, and\n dispatch events from the client component to the\
            \ input method.\n\n \n By default, one InputContext instance is created\
            \ per Window instance,\n and this input context is shared by all components\
            \ within the window's\n container hierarchy. However, this means that\
            \ only one text input\n operation is possible at any one time within a\
            \ window, and that the\n text needs to be committed when moving the focus\
            \ from one text component\n to another. If this is not desired, text components\
            \ can create their\n own input context instances.\n\n \n The Java Platform\
            \ supports input methods that have been developed in the Java\n programming\
            \ language, using the interfaces in the java.awt.im.spi package,\n which\
            \ can be made available by adding them to the application's class path.\n\
            \ Implementations may also support using the native input methods of the\
            \ platforms they run on;\n however, not all platforms and locales provide\
            \ input methods. Keyboard layouts\n are provided by the host platform.\n\
            \n \n Input methods are unavailable if (a) no input method written\n in\
            \ the Java programming language has been installed and (b) the Java Platform\
            \ implementation\n or the underlying platform does not support native\
            \ input methods. In this case,\n input contexts can still be created and\
            \ used; their behavior is specified with\n the individual methods below."
