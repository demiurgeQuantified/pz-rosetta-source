          notes: "This class is the abstract superclass of all actual\n implementations\
            \ of the Abstract Window Toolkit. Subclasses of\n the Toolkit class are\
            \ used to bind the various components\n to particular native toolkit implementations.\n\
            \ \n Many GUI events may be delivered to user\n asynchronously, if the\
            \ opposite is not specified explicitly.\n As well as\n many GUI operations\
            \ may be performed asynchronously.\n This fact means that if the state\
            \ of a component is set, and then\n the state immediately queried, the\
            \ returned value may not yet\n reflect the requested change.  This behavior\
            \ includes, but is not\n limited to:\n \n Scrolling to a specified position.\n\
            \ For example, calling ScrollPane.setScrollPosition\n     and then getScrollPosition\
            \ may return an incorrect\n     value if the original request has not\
            \ yet been processed.\n\n Moving the focus from one component to another.\n\
            \ For more information, see\n Timing\n Focus Transfers, a section in\n\
            \ The Swing\n Tutorial.\n\n Making a top-level container visible.\n Calling\
            \ setVisible(true) on a Window,\n     Frame or Dialog may occur\n    \
            \ asynchronously.\n\n Setting the size or location of a top-level container.\n\
            \ Calls to setSize, setBounds or\n     setLocation on a Window,\n    \
            \ Frame or Dialog are forwarded\n     to the underlying window management\
            \ system and may be\n     ignored or modified.  See Window for\n     more\
            \ information.\n \n \n Most applications should not call any of the methods\
            \ in this\n class directly. The methods defined by Toolkit are\n the \"\
            glue\" that joins the platform-independent classes in the\n java.awt package\
            \ with their counterparts in\n java.awt.peer. Some methods defined by\n\
            \ Toolkit query the native operating system directly."

              \ like Frame.ICONIFIED|Frame.MAXIMIZED_VERT.\n In other words, the rule\
              \ of thumb is that only queries with a\n single frame state constant\
              \ as an argument are meaningful.\n Note that supporting a given concept\
              \ is a platform-\n dependent feature. Due to native limitations the\
              \ Toolkit\n object may report a particular state as supported, however\
              \ at\n the same time the Toolkit object will be unable to apply the\n\
              \ state to a given frame.  This circumstance has two following\n consequences:\n\
              \ \n Only the return value of false for the present\n method actually\
              \ indicates that the given state is not\n supported. If the method returns\
              \ true the given state\n may still be unsupported and/or unavailable\
              \ for a particular\n frame.\n The developer should consider examining\
              \ the value of the\n WindowEvent.getNewState() method of the\n WindowEvent\
              \ received through the WindowStateListener, rather than assuming\n that\
              \ the state given to the setExtendedState() method\n will be definitely\
