          notes: "The Graphics class is the abstract base class for\n all graphics\
            \ contexts that allow an application to draw onto\n components that are\
            \ realized on various devices, as well as\n onto off-screen images.\n\
            \ \n A Graphics object encapsulates state information needed\n for the\
            \ basic rendering operations that Java supports.  This\n state information\
            \ includes the following properties:\n\n \n The Component object on which\
            \ to draw.\n A translation origin for rendering and clipping coordinates.\n\
            \ The current clip.\n The current color.\n The current font.\n The current\
            \ logical pixel operation function (XOR or Paint).\n The current XOR alternation\
            \ color\n     (see setXORMode(java.awt.Color)).\n \n \n Coordinates are\
            \ infinitely thin and lie between the pixels of the\n output device.\n\
            \ Operations that draw the outline of a figure operate by traversing\n\
            \ an infinitely thin path between pixels with a pixel-sized pen that hangs\n\
            \ down and to the right of the anchor point on the path.\n Operations\
            \ that fill a figure operate by filling the interior\n of that infinitely\
            \ thin path.\n Operations that render horizontal text render the ascending\n\
            \ portion of character glyphs entirely above the baseline coordinate.\n\
            \ \n The graphics pen hangs down and to the right from the path it traverses.\n\
            \ This has the following implications:\n \n If you draw a figure that\
            \ covers a given rectangle, that\n figure occupies one extra row of pixels\
            \ on the right and bottom edges\n as compared to filling a figure that\
            \ is bounded by that same rectangle.\n If you draw a horizontal line along\
            \ the same y coordinate as\n the baseline of a line of text, that line\
            \ is drawn entirely below\n the text, except for any descenders.\n \n\
            \ All coordinates that appear as arguments to the methods of this\n Graphics\
            \ object are considered relative to the\n translation origin of this Graphics\
            \ object prior to\n the invocation of the method.\n \n All rendering operations\
            \ modify only pixels which lie within the\n area bounded by the current\
            \ clip, which is specified by a Shape\n in user space and is controlled\
            \ by the program using the\n Graphics object.  This user clip\n is transformed\
            \ into device space and combined with the\n device clip, which is defined\
            \ by the visibility of windows and\n device extents.  The combination\
            \ of the user clip and device clip\n defines the composite clip, which\
            \ determines the final clipping\n region.  The user clip cannot be modified\
            \ by the rendering\n system to reflect the resulting composite clip. The\
            \ user clip can only\n be changed through the setClip or clipRect\n methods.\n\
            \ All drawing or writing is done in the current color,\n using the current\
            \ paint mode, and in the current font."
