          notes: "The TextComponent class is the superclass of\n any component that\
            \ allows the editing of some text.\n \n A text component embodies a string\
            \ of text.  The\n TextComponent class defines a set of methods\n that\
            \ determine whether or not this text is editable. If the\n component is\
            \ editable, it defines another set of methods\n that supports a text insertion\
            \ caret.\n \n In addition, the class defines methods that are used\n to\
            \ maintain a current selection from the text.\n The text selection, a\
            \ substring of the component's text,\n is the target of editing operations.\
            \ It is also referred\n to as the selected text."
