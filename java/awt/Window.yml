          notes: "A Window object is a top-level window with no borders and no\n menubar.\n\
            \ The default layout for a window is BorderLayout.\n \n A window must\
            \ have either a frame, dialog, or another window defined as its\n owner\
            \ when it's constructed.\n \n In a multi-screen environment, you can create\
            \ a Window\n on a different screen device by constructing the Window\n\
            \ with Window(Window, GraphicsConfiguration).  The\n GraphicsConfiguration\
            \ object is one of the\n GraphicsConfiguration objects of the target screen\
            \ device.\n \n In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the\
            \ desktop\n area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds\
            \ of all\n configurations are relative to the virtual device coordinate\
            \ system.\n The origin of the virtual-coordinate system is at the upper\
            \ left-hand\n corner of the primary physical screen.  Depending on the\
            \ location of\n the primary screen in the virtual device, negative coordinates\
            \ are\n possible, as shown in the following figure.\n \n \n \n In such\
            \ an environment, when calling setLocation,\n you must pass a virtual\
            \ coordinate to this method.  Similarly,\n calling getLocationOnScreen\
            \ on a Window returns\n virtual device coordinates.  Call the getBounds\
            \ method\n of a GraphicsConfiguration to find its origin in the virtual\n\
            \ coordinate system.\n \n The following code sets the location of a Window\n\
            \ at (10, 10) relative to the origin of the physical screen\n of the corresponding\
            \ GraphicsConfiguration.  If the\n bounds of the GraphicsConfiguration\
            \ is not taken\n into account, the Window location would be set\n at (10,\
            \ 10) relative to the virtual-coordinate system and would appear\n on\
            \ the primary physical screen, which might be different from the\n physical\
            \ screen of the specified GraphicsConfiguration.\n\n \n      Window w\
            \ = new Window(Window owner, GraphicsConfiguration gc);\n      Rectangle\
            \ bounds = gc.getBounds();\n      w.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y);\n\
            \ \n\n \n Note: the location and size of top-level windows (including\n\
            \ Windows, Frames, and Dialogs)\n are under the control of the desktop's\
            \ window management system.\n Calls to setLocation, setSize, and\n setBounds\
            \ are requests (not directives) which are\n forwarded to the window management\
            \ system.  Every effort will be\n made to honor such requests.  However,\
            \ in some cases the window\n management system may ignore such requests,\
            \ or modify the requested\n geometry in order to place and size the Window\
            \ in a way\n that more closely matches the desktop settings.\n \n Visual\
            \ effects such as halos, shadows, motion effects and animations may be\n\
            \ applied to the window by the desktop window management system. These\
            \ are\n outside the knowledge and control of the AWT and so for the purposes\
            \ of this\n specification are not considered part of the top-level window.\n\
            \ \n Due to the asynchronous nature of native event handling, the results\n\
            \ returned by getBounds, getLocation,\n getLocationOnScreen, and getSize\
            \ might not\n reflect the actual geometry of the Window on screen until\
            \ the last\n request has been processed.  During the processing of subsequent\n\
            \ requests these values might change accordingly while the window\n management\
            \ system fulfills the requests.\n \n An application may set the size and\
            \ location of an invisible\n Window arbitrarily, but the window management\
            \ system may\n subsequently change its size and/or location when the\n\
            \ Window is made visible. One or more ComponentEvents\n will be generated\
            \ to indicate the new geometry.\n \n Windows are capable of generating\
            \ the following WindowEvents:\n WindowOpened, WindowClosed, WindowGainedFocus,\
            \ WindowLostFocus."
