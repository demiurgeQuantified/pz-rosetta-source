          notes: "The Choice class presents a pop-up menu of choices.\n The current\
            \ choice is displayed as the title of the menu.\n \n The following code\
            \ example produces a pop-up menu:\n\n \n Choice ColorChooser = new Choice();\n\
            \ ColorChooser.add(\"Green\");\n ColorChooser.add(\"Red\");\n ColorChooser.add(\"\
            Blue\");\n \n \n After this choice menu has been added to a panel,\n it\
            \ appears as follows in its normal state:\n \n \n \n In the picture, \"\
            Green\" is the current choice.\n Pushing the mouse button down on the\
            \ object causes a menu to\n appear with the current choice highlighted.\n\
            \ \n Some native platforms do not support arbitrary resizing of\n Choice\
            \ components and the behavior of\n setSize()/getSize() is bound by\n such\
            \ limitations.\n Native GUI Choice components' size are often bound by\
            \ such\n attributes as font size and length of items contained within\n\
            \ the Choice."
