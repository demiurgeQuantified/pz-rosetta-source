          notes: "The Font class represents fonts, which are used to\n render text\
            \ in a visible way.\n A font provides the information needed to map sequences\
            \ of\n characters to sequences of glyphs\n and to render sequences of\
            \ glyphs on Graphics and\n Component objects.\n\n Characters and Glyphs\n\
            \n A character is a symbol that represents an item such as a letter,\n\
            \ a digit, or punctuation in an abstract way. For example, 'g',\n LATIN\
            \ SMALL LETTER G, is a character.\n \n A glyph is a shape used to render\
            \ a character or a sequence of\n characters. In simple writing systems,\
            \ such as Latin, typically one glyph\n represents one character. In general,\
            \ however, characters and glyphs do not\n have one-to-one correspondence.\
            \ For example, the character '&aacute;'\n LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE,\
            \ can be represented by\n two glyphs: one for 'a' and one for '&acute;'.\
            \ On the other hand, the\n two-character string \"fi\" can be represented\
            \ by a single glyph, an\n \"fi\" ligature. In complex writing systems,\
            \ such as Arabic or the South\n and South-East Asian writing systems,\
            \ the relationship between characters\n and glyphs can be more complicated\
            \ and involve context-dependent selection\n of glyphs as well as glyph\
            \ reordering.\n\n A font encapsulates the collection of glyphs needed\
            \ to render a selected set\n of characters as well as the tables needed\
            \ to map sequences of characters to\n corresponding sequences of glyphs.\n\
            \n Physical and Logical Fonts\n\n The Java Platform distinguishes between\
            \ two kinds of fonts:\n physical fonts and logical fonts.\n \n Physical\
            \ fonts are the actual font libraries containing glyph data\n and tables\
            \ to map from character sequences to glyph sequences, using a font\n technology\
            \ such as TrueType or PostScript Type 1.\n All implementations of the\
            \ Java Platform must support TrueType fonts;\n support for other font\
            \ technologies is implementation dependent.\n Physical fonts may use names\
            \ such as Helvetica, Palatino, HonMincho, or\n any number of other font\
            \ names.\n Typically, each physical font supports only a limited set of\
            \ writing\n systems, for example, only Latin characters or only Japanese\
            \ and Basic\n Latin.\n The set of available physical fonts varies between\
            \ configurations.\n Applications that require specific fonts can bundle\
            \ them and instantiate\n them using the createFont method.\n \n Logical\
            \ fonts are the five font families defined by the Java\n platform which\
            \ must be supported by any Java runtime environment:\n Serif, SansSerif,\
            \ Monospaced, Dialog, and DialogInput.\n These logical fonts are not actual\
            \ font libraries. Instead, the logical\n font names are mapped to physical\
            \ fonts by the Java runtime environment.\n The mapping is implementation\
            \ and usually locale dependent, so the look\n and the metrics provided\
            \ by them vary.\n Typically, each logical font name maps to several physical\
            \ fonts in order to\n cover a large range of characters.\n \n Peered AWT\
            \ components, such as Label and\n TextField, can only use logical fonts.\n\
            \ \n For a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of\
            \ using\n physical or logical fonts, see the\n \n    Physical and Logical\
            \ Fonts\n in The Java Tutorials\n document.\n\n Font Faces and Names\n\
            \n A Font\n can have many faces, such as heavy, medium, oblique, gothic\
            \ and\n regular. All of these faces have similar typographic design.\n\
            \ \n There are three different names that you can get from a\n Font object.\
            \  The logical font name is simply the\n name that was used to construct\
            \ the font.\n The font face name, or just font name for\n short, is the\
            \ name of a particular font face, like Helvetica Bold. The\n family name\
            \ is the name of the font family that determines the\n typographic design\
            \ across several faces, like Helvetica.\n \n The Font class represents\
            \ an instance of a font face from\n a collection of  font faces that are\
            \ present in the system resources\n of the host system.  As examples,\
            \ Arial Bold and Courier Bold Italic\n are font faces.  There can be several\
            \ Font objects\n associated with a font face, each differing in size,\
            \ style, transform\n and font features.\n \n Glyphs may not always be\
            \ rendered with the requested properties (e.g, font\n and style) due to\
            \ platform limitations such as the absence of suitable\n platform fonts\
            \ to implement a logical font.\n \n The getAllFonts method\n of the GraphicsEnvironment\
            \ class returns an\n array of all font faces available in the system.\
            \ These font faces are\n returned as Font objects with a size of 1, identity\n\
            \ transform and default font features. These\n base fonts can then be\
            \ used to derive new Font objects\n with varying sizes, styles, transforms\
            \ and font features via the\n deriveFont methods in this class.\n\n Font\
            \ and TextAttribute\n\n Font supports most\n TextAttributes.  This makes\
            \ some operations, such as\n rendering underlined text, convenient since\
            \ it is not\n necessary to explicitly construct a TextLayout object.\n\
            \ Attributes can be set on a Font by constructing or deriving it\n using\
            \ a Map of TextAttribute values.\n\n The values of some TextAttributes\
            \ are not\n serializable, and therefore attempting to serialize an instance\
            \ of\n Font that has such values will not serialize them.\n This means\
            \ a Font deserialized from such a stream will not compare\n equal to the\
            \ original Font that contained the non-serializable\n attributes.  This\
            \ should very rarely pose a problem\n since these attributes are typically\
            \ used only in special\n circumstances and are unlikely to be serialized.\n\
            \n \n FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND use\n Paint values. The subclass Color\
            \ is\n serializable, while GradientPaint and\n TexturePaint are not.\n\
            \ CHAR_REPLACEMENT uses\n GraphicAttribute values.  The subclasses\n ShapeGraphicAttribute\
            \ and\n ImageGraphicAttribute are not serializable.\n INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT\
            \ uses\n InputMethodHighlight values, which are\n not serializable.  See\
            \ InputMethodHighlight.\n \n\n Clients who create custom subclasses of\
            \ Paint and\n GraphicAttribute can make them serializable and\n avoid\
            \ this problem.  Clients who use input method highlights can\n convert\
            \ these to the platform-specific attributes for that\n highlight on the\
            \ current platform and set them on the Font as\n a workaround.\n\n The\
            \ Map-based constructor and\n deriveFont APIs ignore the FONT attribute,\
            \ and it is\n not retained by the Font; the static getFont(java.util.Map<?\
            \ extends java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute, ?>) method\
            \ should\n be used if the FONT attribute might be present.  See TextAttribute.FONT\
            \ for more information.\n\n Several attributes will cause additional rendering\
            \ overhead\n and potentially invoke layout.  If a Font has such\n attributes,\
            \ the hasLayoutAttributes() method\n will return true.\n\n Note: Font\
            \ rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated.  In\n order to account\
            \ for this (rare) possibility, font APIs are\n specified to return metrics\
            \ and take parameters 'in\n baseline-relative coordinates'.  This maps\
            \ the 'x' coordinate to\n the advance along the baseline, (positive x\
            \ is forward along the\n baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance\
            \ along the\n perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees\n\
            \ clockwise from the baseline vector).  APIs for which this is\n especially\
            \ important are called out as having 'baseline-relative\n coordinates.'"

              \ size.\n \n The font name can be a font face name or a font family\
              \ name.\n It is used together with the style to find an appropriate\
              \ font face.\n When a font family name is specified, the style argument\
              \ is used to\n select the most appropriate face from the family. When\
              \ a font face\n name is specified, the face's style and the style argument\
              \ are\n merged to locate the best matching font from the same family.\n\
              \ For example if face name \"Arial Bold\" is specified with style\n\
              \ Font.ITALIC, the font system looks for a face in the\n \"Arial\" family\
              \ that is bold and italic, and may associate the font\n instance with\
              \ the physical font face \"Arial Bold Italic\".\n The style argument\
              \ is merged with the specified face's style, not\n added or subtracted.\n\
              \ This means, specifying a bold face and a bold style does not\n double-embolden\
              \ the font, and specifying a bold face and a plain\n style does not\
              \ lighten the font.\n \n If no face for the requested style can be found,\
              \ the font system\n may apply algorithmic styling to achieve the desired\
              \ style.\n For example, if ITALIC is requested, but no italic\n face\
              \ is available, glyphs from the plain face may be algorithmically\n\
              \ obliqued (slanted).\n \n Font name lookup is case insensitive, using\
              \ the case folding\n rules of the US locale.\n \n If the name parameter\
              \ represents something other than a\n logical font, i.e. is interpreted\
              \ as a physical font face or family, and\n this cannot be mapped by\
              \ the implementation to a physical font or a\n compatible alternative,\
              \ then the font system will map the Font\n instance to \"Dialog\", such\
              \ that for example, the family as reported\n by getFamily will be \"\
              Dialog\"."
