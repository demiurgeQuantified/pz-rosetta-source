          notes: "This class is the base class for\n DragSourceDragEvent and\n DragSourceDropEvent.\n\
            \ \n DragSourceEvents are generated whenever the drag enters, moves\n\
            \ over, or exits a drop site, when the drop action changes, and when the\
            \ drag\n ends. The location for the generated DragSourceEvent specifies\n\
            \ the mouse cursor location in screen coordinates at the moment this event\n\
            \ occurred.\n \n In a multi-screen environment without a virtual device,\
            \ the cursor location is\n specified in the coordinate system of the initiator\n\
            \ GraphicsConfiguration. The initiator\n GraphicsConfiguration is the\
            \ GraphicsConfiguration\n of the Component on which the drag gesture for\
            \ the current drag\n operation was recognized. If the cursor location\
            \ is outside the bounds of\n the initiator GraphicsConfiguration, the\
            \ reported coordinates are\n clipped to fit within the bounds of that\
            \ GraphicsConfiguration.\n \n In a multi-screen environment with a virtual\
            \ device, the location is specified\n in the corresponding virtual coordinate\
            \ system. If the cursor location is\n outside the bounds of the virtual\
            \ device the reported coordinates are\n clipped to fit within the bounds\
            \ of the virtual device."
