          notes: "The DragSourceContext class is responsible for managing the\n initiator\
            \ side of the Drag and Drop protocol. In particular, it is responsible\n\
            \ for managing drag event notifications to the\n DragSourceListeners\n\
            \ and DragSourceMotionListeners, and providing the\n Transferable representing\
            \ the source data for the drag operation.\n \n Note that the DragSourceContext\
            \ itself\n implements the DragSourceListener and\n DragSourceMotionListener\
            \ interfaces.\n This is to allow the platform peer\n (the DragSourceContextPeer\
            \ instance)\n created by the DragSource to notify\n the DragSourceContext\
            \ of\n state changes in the ongoing operation. This allows the\n DragSourceContext\
            \ object to interpose\n itself between the platform and the\n listeners\
            \ provided by the initiator of the drag operation.\n \n \n By default,\
            \ DragSourceContext sets the cursor as appropriate\n for the current state\
            \ of the drag and drop operation. For example, if\n the user has chosen\
            \ the move action,\n and the pointer is over a target that accepts\n the\
            \ move action, the default move cursor is shown. When\n the pointer is\
            \ over an area that does not accept the transfer,\n the default \"no drop\"\
            \ cursor is shown.\n \n This default handling mechanism is disabled when\
            \ a custom cursor is set\n by the setCursor(java.awt.Cursor) method. When\
            \ the default handling is disabled,\n it becomes the responsibility\n\
            \ of the developer to keep the cursor up to date, by listening\n to the\
            \ DragSource events and calling the setCursor() method.\n Alternatively,\
            \ you can provide custom cursor behavior by providing\n custom implementations\
            \ of the DragSource\n and the DragSourceContext classes."
