            \ actions\n and the user drop action that reflect the current state of\
            \ the\n drag-and-drop operation.\n \n Source drop actions is a bitwise\
            \ mask of DnDConstants\n that represents the set of drop actions supported\
            \ by the drag source for\n this drag-and-drop operation.\n \n User drop\
            \ action depends on the drop actions supported by the drag\n source and\
            \ the drop action selected by the user. The user can select a drop\n action\
            \ by pressing modifier keys during the drag operation:\n \n   Ctrl + Shift\
            \ -> ACTION_LINK\n   Ctrl         -> ACTION_COPY\n   Shift        -> ACTION_MOVE\n\
            \ \n If the user selects a drop action, the user drop action is one of\n\
            \ DnDConstants that represents the selected drop action if this\n drop\
            \ action is supported by the drag source or\n DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE\
            \ if this drop action is not supported\n by the drag source.\n \n If the\
            \ user doesn't select a drop action, the set of\n DnDConstants that represents\
            \ the set of drop actions supported\n by the drag source is searched for\
            \ DnDConstants.ACTION_MOVE,\n then for DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY, then\
            \ for\n DnDConstants.ACTION_LINK and the user drop action is the\n first\
            \ constant found. If no constant is found the user drop action\n is DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE."
