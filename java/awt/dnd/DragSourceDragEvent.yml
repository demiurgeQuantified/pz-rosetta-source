            \ that DragSourceContext and with its associated\n DragSource.\n \n The\
            \ DragSourceDragEvent reports the target drop action\n and the user drop\
            \ action that reflect the current state of\n the drag operation.\n \n\
            \ Target drop action is one of DnDConstants that represents\n the drop\
            \ action selected by the current drop target if this drop action is\n\
            \ supported by the drag source or DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE if this\n drop\
            \ action is not supported by the drag source.\n \n User drop action depends\
            \ on the drop actions supported by the drag\n source and the drop action\
            \ selected by the user. The user can select a drop\n action by pressing\
            \ modifier keys during the drag operation:\n \n   Ctrl + Shift -> ACTION_LINK\n\
            \   Ctrl         -> ACTION_COPY\n   Shift        -> ACTION_MOVE\n \n If\
            \ the user selects a drop action, the user drop action is one of\n DnDConstants\

            \ by the drag source or\n DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE if this drop action\
            \ is not supported\n by the drag source.\n \n If the user doesn't select\
            \ a drop action, the set of\n DnDConstants that represents the set of\
            \ drop actions supported\n by the drag source is searched for DnDConstants.ACTION_MOVE,\n\
            \ then for DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY, then for\n DnDConstants.ACTION_LINK\
            \ and the user drop action is the\n first constant found. If no constant\
            \ is found the user drop action\n is DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE."
