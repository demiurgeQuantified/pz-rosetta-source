            \     \n      addition of an ancestor\n      removal of an ancestor\n\
            \      hierarchy made displayable\n      hierarchy made undisplayable\n\
            \      hierarchy shown on the screen (both visible and displayable)\n\
            \      hierarchy hidden on the screen (either invisible or undisplayable)\n\

            \ \n Hierarchy events are provided for notification purposes ONLY.\n The\
            \ AWT will automatically handle changes to the hierarchy internally so\n\
            \ that GUI layout and displayability works properly regardless of whether\
            \ a\n program is receiving these events or not.\n \n This event is generated\
            \ by a Container object (such as a Panel) when the\n Container is added,\
            \ removed, moved, or resized, and passed down the\n hierarchy. It is also\
            \ generated by a Component object when that object's\n addNotify, removeNotify,\
            \ show, or\n hide method is called. The ANCESTOR_MOVED and\n ANCESTOR_RESIZED\n\
            \ events are dispatched to every HierarchyBoundsListener or\n HierarchyBoundsAdapter\
            \ object which registered to receive\n such events using the Component's\
            \ addHierarchyBoundsListener\n method. (HierarchyBoundsAdapter objects\
            \ implement the\n HierarchyBoundsListener interface.) The HIERARCHY_CHANGED\
            \ events are\n dispatched to every HierarchyListener object which registered\n\
            \ to receive such events using the Component's addHierarchyListener\n\
            \ method. Each such listener object gets this HierarchyEvent\n when the\
            \ event occurs.\n \n An unspecified behavior will be caused if the id\
            \ parameter\n of any particular HierarchyEvent instance is not\n in the\
            \ range from HIERARCHY_FIRST to HIERARCHY_LAST.\n \n The changeFlags parameter\
            \ of any HierarchyEvent instance takes one of the following\n values:\n\
            \ \n  HierarchyEvent.PARENT_CHANGED\n  HierarchyEvent.DISPLAYABILITY_CHANGED\n\
            \  HierarchyEvent.SHOWING_CHANGED\n \n Assigning the value different from\
            \ listed above will cause unspecified behavior."
