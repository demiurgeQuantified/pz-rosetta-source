          notes: "A low-level event which indicates that a component moved, changed\n\
            \ size, or changed visibility (also, the root class for the other\n component-level\
            \ events).\n \n Component events are provided for notification purposes\
            \ ONLY;\n The AWT will automatically handle component moves and resizes\n\
            \ internally so that GUI layout works properly regardless of\n whether\
            \ a program is receiving these events or not.\n \n In addition to serving\
            \ as the base class for other component-related\n events (InputEvent,\
            \ FocusEvent, WindowEvent, ContainerEvent),\n this class defines the events\
            \ that indicate changes in\n a component's size, position, or visibility.\n\
            \ \n This low-level event is generated by a component object (such as\
            \ a\n List) when the component is moved, resized, rendered invisible,\
            \ or made\n visible again. The event is passed to every ComponentListener\n\
            \ or ComponentAdapter object which registered to receive such\n events\
            \ using the component's addComponentListener method.\n (ComponentAdapter\
            \ objects implement the\n ComponentListener interface.) Each such listener\
            \ object\n gets this ComponentEvent when the event occurs.\n \n An unspecified\
            \ behavior will be caused if the id parameter\n of any particular ComponentEvent\
            \ instance is not\n in the range from COMPONENT_FIRST to COMPONENT_LAST."
