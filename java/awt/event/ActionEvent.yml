          notes: "A semantic event which indicates that a component-defined action\
            \ occurred.\n This high-level event is generated by a component (such\
            \ as a\n Button) when\n the component-specific action occurs (such as\
            \ being pressed).\n The event is passed to every ActionListener object\n\
            \ that registered to receive such events using the component's\n addActionListener\
            \ method.\n \n Note: To invoke an ActionEvent on a\n Button using the\
            \ keyboard, use the Space bar.\n \n The object that implements the ActionListener\
            \ interface\n gets this ActionEvent when the event occurs. The listener\n\
            \ is therefore spared the details of processing individual mouse movements\n\
            \ and mouse clicks, and can instead process a \"meaningful\" (semantic)\n\
            \ event like \"button pressed\".\n \n An unspecified behavior will be\
            \ caused if the id parameter\n of any particular ActionEvent instance\
            \ is not\n in the range from ACTION_FIRST to ACTION_LAST."
