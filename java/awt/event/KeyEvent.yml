          notes: "An event which indicates that a keystroke occurred in a component.\n\
            \ \n This low-level event is generated by a component object (such as\
            \ a text\n field) when a key is pressed, released, or typed.\n The event\
            \ is passed to every KeyListener\n or KeyAdapter object which registered\
            \ to receive such\n events using the component's addKeyListener method.\n\
            \ (KeyAdapter objects implement the\n KeyListener interface.)  Each such\
            \ listener object\n gets this KeyEvent when the event occurs.\n \n \"\
            Key typed\" events are higher-level and generally do not depend on\n the\
            \ platform or keyboard layout.  They are generated when a Unicode character\n\
            \ is entered, and are the preferred way to find out about character input.\n\
            \ In the simplest case, a key typed event is produced by a single key\
            \ press\n (e.g., 'a').  Often, however, characters are produced by series\
            \ of key\n presses (e.g., 'shift' + 'a'), and the mapping from key pressed\
            \ events to\n key typed events may be many-to-one or many-to-many.  Key\
            \ releases are not\n usually necessary to generate a key typed event,\
            \ but there are some cases\n where the key typed event is not generated\
            \ until a key is released (e.g.,\n entering ASCII sequences via the Alt-Numpad\
            \ method in Windows).\n No key typed events are generated for keys that\
            \ don't generate Unicode\n characters (e.g., action keys, modifier keys,\
            \ etc.).\n \n The getKeyChar method always returns a valid Unicode character\
            \ or\n CHAR_UNDEFINED.  Character input is reported by KEY_TYPED events:\n\
            \ KEY_PRESSED and KEY_RELEASED events are not necessarily associated\n\
            \ with character input.  Therefore, the result of the getKeyChar method\n\
            \ is guaranteed to be meaningful only for KEY_TYPED events.\n \n For key\
            \ pressed and key released events, the getKeyCode method returns\n the\
            \ event's keyCode.  For key typed events, the getKeyCode method\n always\
            \ returns VK_UNDEFINED. The getExtendedKeyCode method\n may also be used\
            \ with many international keyboard layouts.\n\n \n \"Key pressed\" and\
            \ \"key released\" events are lower-level and depend\n on the platform\
            \ and keyboard layout. They are generated whenever a key is\n pressed\
            \ or released, and are the only way to find out about keys that don't\n\
            \ generate character input (e.g., action keys, modifier keys, etc.). The\
            \ key\n being pressed or released is indicated by the getKeyCode and getExtendedKeyCode\n\
            \ methods, which return a virtual key code.\n\n \n Virtual key codes are\
            \ used to report which keyboard key has\n been pressed, rather than a\
            \ character generated by the combination\n of one or more keystrokes (such\
            \ as \"A\", which comes from shift and \"a\").\n\n \n For example, pressing\
            \ the Shift key will cause a KEY_PRESSED event\n with a VK_SHIFT keyCode,\
            \ while pressing the 'a' key will result in\n a VK_A keyCode.  After the\
            \ 'a' key is released, a KEY_RELEASED event\n will be fired with VK_A.\
            \ Separately, a KEY_TYPED event with a keyChar\n value of 'A' is generated.\n\
            \n \n Pressing and releasing a key on the keyboard results in the generating\n\
            \ the following key events (in order):\n \n    <code>KEY_PRESSED</code>\n\
            \    <code>KEY_TYPED</code> (is only generated if a valid Unicode character\
            \ could be generated.)\n    <code>KEY_RELEASED</code>\n \n\n But in some\
            \ cases (e.g. auto-repeat or input method is activated) the order\n could\
            \ be different (and platform dependent).\n\n \n Notes:\n \n Key combinations\
            \ which do not result in Unicode characters, such as action\n keys like\
            \ F1 and the HELP key, do not generate KEY_TYPED events.\n Not all keyboards\
            \ or systems are capable of generating all\n virtual key codes.  No attempt\
            \ is made in Java to generate these keys\n artificially.\n Virtual key\
            \ codes do not identify a physical key: they depend on the\n platform\
            \ and keyboard layout. For example, the key that generates VK_Q\n when\
            \ using a U.S. keyboard layout will generate VK_A when using a French\n\
            \ keyboard layout.\n The key that generates VK_Q when using a U.S. keyboard\
            \ layout also\n generates a unique code for Russian or Hebrew layout.\
            \ There is no a\n VK_ constant for these and many other codes in various\
            \ layouts. These codes\n may be obtained by using getExtendedKeyCode and\
            \ are used whenever\n a VK_ constant is used.\n Not all characters have\
            \ a keycode associated with them.  For example,\n there is no keycode\
            \ for the question mark because there is no keyboard\n for which it appears\
            \ on the primary layer.\n In order to support the platform-independent\
            \ handling of action keys,\n the Java platform uses a few additional virtual\
            \ key constants for functions\n that would otherwise have to be recognized\
            \ by interpreting virtual key codes\n and modifiers. For example, for\
            \ Japanese Windows keyboards, VK_ALL_CANDIDATES\n is returned instead\
            \ of VK_CONVERT with the ALT modifier.\n As specified in Focus Specification\n\
            \ key events are dispatched to the focus owner by default.\n \n\n \n WARNING:\
            \ Aside from those keys that are defined by the Java language\n (VK_ENTER,\
            \ VK_BACK_SPACE, and VK_TAB), do not rely on the values of the VK_\n constants.\
            \  The platform steward reserves the right to change these values as needed\n\
            \ to accommodate a wider range of keyboards in the future.\n \n An unspecified\
            \ behavior will be caused if the id parameter\n of any particular KeyEvent\
            \ instance is not\n in the range from KEY_FIRST to KEY_LAST."
