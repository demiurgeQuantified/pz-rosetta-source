          notes: "A semantic event which indicates that an item was selected or deselected.\n\
            \ This high-level event is generated by an ItemSelectable object (such\
            \ as a\n List) when an item is selected or deselected by the user.\n The\
            \ event is passed to every ItemListener object which\n registered to receive\
            \ such events using the component's\n addItemListener method.\n \n The\
            \ object that implements the ItemListener interface gets\n this ItemEvent\
            \ when the event occurs. The listener is\n spared the details of processing\
            \ individual mouse movements and mouse\n clicks, and can instead process\
            \ a \"meaningful\" (semantic) event like\n \"item selected\" or \"item\
            \ deselected\".\n \n An unspecified behavior will be caused if the id\
            \ parameter\n of any particular ItemEvent instance is not\n in the range\
            \ from ITEM_FIRST to ITEM_LAST.\n \n The stateChange of any ItemEvent\
            \ instance takes one of the following\n values:\n                    \
            \ \n                      ItemEvent.SELECTED\n                      ItemEvent.DESELECTED\n\
            \                     \n Assigning the value different from listed above\
            \ will cause an unspecified behavior."
