          notes: "An abstract adapter class for receiving window events.\n The methods\
            \ in this class are empty. This class exists as\n convenience for creating\
            \ listener objects.\n \n Extend this class to create a WindowEvent listener\n\
            \ and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement\
            \ the\n WindowListener interface, you have to define all of\n the methods\
            \ in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them\n all, so you\
            \ can only have to define methods for events you care about.)\n \n Create\
            \ a listener object using the extended class and then register it with\n\
            \ a Window using the window's addWindowListener\n method. When the window's\
            \ status changes by virtue of being opened,\n closed, activated or deactivated,\
            \ iconified or deiconified,\n the relevant method in the listener\n object\
            \ is invoked, and the WindowEvent is passed to it."
