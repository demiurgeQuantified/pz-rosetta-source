          notes: "A low-level event which indicates that a Component has gained or\
            \ lost the\n input focus. This low-level event is generated by a Component\
            \ (such as a\n TextField). The event is passed to every FocusListener\
            \ or\n FocusAdapter object which registered to receive such events\n using\
            \ the Component's addFocusListener method.\n (FocusAdapter objects implement\
            \ the FocusListener\n interface.) Each such listener object gets this\
            \ FocusEvent when\n the event occurs.\n \n There are two levels of focus\
            \ events: permanent and temporary. Permanent\n focus change events occur\
            \ when focus is directly moved from one Component to\n another, such as\
            \ through a call to requestFocus() or as the user uses the\n TAB key to\
            \ traverse Components. Temporary focus change events occur when\n focus\
            \ is temporarily lost for a Component as the indirect result of another\n\
            \ operation, such as Window deactivation or a Scrollbar drag. In this\
            \ case,\n the original focus state will automatically be restored once\
            \ that operation\n is finished, or, for the case of Window deactivation,\
            \ when the Window is\n reactivated. Both permanent and temporary focus\
            \ events are delivered using\n the FOCUS_GAINED and FOCUS_LOST event ids;\
            \ the level may be distinguished in\n the event using the isTemporary()\
            \ method.\n \n Every FocusEvent records its cause - the reason why this\
            \ event was\n generated. The cause is assigned during the focus event\
            \ creation and may be\n retrieved by calling getCause().\n \n An unspecified\
            \ behavior will be caused if the id parameter\n of any particular FocusEvent\
            \ instance is not\n in the range from FOCUS_FIRST to FOCUS_LAST."
