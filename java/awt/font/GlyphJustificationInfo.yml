          notes: "The GlyphJustificationInfo class represents information\n about\
            \ the justification properties of a glyph.  A glyph is the visual\n representation\
            \ of one or more characters.  Many different glyphs can\n be used to represent\
            \ a single character or combination of characters.\n The four justification\
            \ properties represented by\n GlyphJustificationInfo are weight, priority,\
            \ absorb and\n limit.\n \n Weight is the overall 'weight' of the glyph\
            \ in the line.  Generally it is\n proportional to the size of the font.\
            \  Glyphs with larger weight are\n allocated a correspondingly larger\
            \ amount of the change in space.\n \n Priority determines the justification\
            \ phase in which this glyph is used.\n All glyphs of the same priority\
            \ are examined before glyphs of the next\n priority.  If all the change\
            \ in space can be allocated to these glyphs\n without exceeding their\
            \ limits, then glyphs of the next priority are not\n examined. There are\
            \ four priorities, kashida, whitespace, interchar,\n and none.  KASHIDA\
            \ is the first priority examined. NONE is the last\n priority examined.\n\
            \ \n Absorb determines whether a glyph absorbs all change in space.  Within\
            \ a\n given priority, some glyphs may absorb all the change in space.\
            \  If any of\n these glyphs are present, no glyphs of later priority are\
            \ examined.\n \n Limit determines the maximum or minimum amount by which\
            \ the glyph can\n change. Left and right sides of the glyph can have different\
            \ limits.\n \n Each GlyphJustificationInfo represents two sets of\n metrics,\
            \ which are growing and shrinking.  Growing\n metrics are used when the\
            \ glyphs on a line are to be\n spread apart to fit a larger width.  Shrinking\
            \ metrics are used when\n the glyphs are to be moved together to fit a\
            \ smaller width."
