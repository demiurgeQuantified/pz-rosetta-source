                \ that normal resolution of a\n Font from attributes should be performed.\n\
                \n TextLayout and\n AttributedCharacterIterator work in terms of\n\
                \ Maps of TextAttributes.  Normally,\n all the attributes are examined\
                \ and used to select and\n configure a Font instance.  If a FONT\n\
                \ attribute is present, though, its associated Font\n will be used.\
                \  This provides a way for users to override the\n resolution of font\
                \ attributes into a Font, or\n force use of a particular Font instance.\
                \  This\n also allows users to specify subclasses of Font in\n cases\
                \ where a Font can be subclassed.\n\n FONT is used for special situations\
                \ where\n clients already have a Font instance but still\n need to\
                \ use Map-based APIs.  Typically, there will\n be no other attributes\
                \ in the Map except the\n FONT attribute.  With Map-based APIs\n the\
                \ common case is to specify all attributes individually, so\n FONT\
                \ is not needed or desirable.\n\n However, if both FONT and other\
                \ attributes are\n present in the Map, the rendering system will\n\
                \ merge the attributes defined in the Font with the\n additional attributes.\
                \  This merging process classifies\n TextAttributes into two groups.\
                \  One group, the\n 'primary' group, is considered fundamental to\
                \ the selection and\n metric behavior of a font.  These attributes\
                \ are\n FAMILY, WEIGHT, WIDTH,\n POSTURE, SIZE,\n TRANSFORM, SUPERSCRIPT,\
                \ and\n TRACKING. The other group, the 'secondary' group,\n consists\
                \ of all other defined attributes, with the exception of\n FONT itself.\n\
                \n To generate the new Map, first the\n Font is obtained from the\
                \ FONT\n attribute, and all of its attributes extracted into a\n new\
                \ Map.  Then only the secondary\n attributes from the original Map\
                \ are added to\n those in the new Map.  Thus the values of primary\n\
                \ attributes come solely from the Font, and the\n values of secondary\
                \ attributes originate with the\n Font but can be overridden by other\
                \ values in the\n Map.\n\n Note:Font's Map-based\n constructor and\
                \ deriveFont methods do not process\n the FONT attribute, as these\
                \ are used to create\n new Font objects.  Instead, Font.getFont(Map)\
                \ should be used to\n handle the FONT attribute."
