          notes: "This class is used with the CHAR_REPLACEMENT attribute.\n \n The\
            \ GraphicAttribute class represents a graphic embedded\n in text. Clients\
            \ subclass this class to implement their own char\n replacement graphics.\
            \  Clients wishing to embed shapes and images in\n text need not subclass\
            \ this class.  Instead, clients can use the\n ShapeGraphicAttribute and\
            \ ImageGraphicAttribute\n classes.\n \n Subclasses must ensure that their\
            \ objects are immutable once they\n are constructed.  Mutating a GraphicAttribute\
            \ that\n is used in a TextLayout results in undefined behavior from the\n\
