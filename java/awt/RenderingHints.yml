          notes: "The RenderingHints class defines and manages collections of\n keys\
            \ and associated values which allow an application to provide input\n\
            \ into the choice of algorithms used by other classes which perform\n\
            \ rendering and image manipulation services.\n The Graphics2D class, and\
            \ classes that implement\n BufferedImageOp and\n RasterOp all provide\
            \ methods to get and\n possibly to set individual or groups of RenderingHints\n\
            \ keys and their associated values.\n When those implementations perform\
            \ any rendering or image manipulation\n operations they should examine\
            \ the values of any RenderingHints\n that were requested by the caller\
            \ and tailor the algorithms used\n accordingly and to the best of their\
            \ ability.\n \n Note that since these keys and values are hints, there\
            \ is\n no requirement that a given implementation supports all possible\n\
            \ choices indicated below or that it can respond to requests to\n modify\
            \ its choice of algorithm.\n The values of the various hint keys may also\
            \ interact such that\n while all variants of a given key are supported\
            \ in one situation,\n the implementation may be more restricted when the\
            \ values associated\n with other keys are modified.\n For example, some\
            \ implementations may be able to provide several\n types of dithering\
            \ when the antialiasing hint is turned off, but\n have little control\
            \ over dithering when antialiasing is on.\n The full set of supported\
            \ keys and hints may also vary by destination\n since runtimes may use\
            \ different underlying modules to render to\n the screen, or to BufferedImage\
            \ objects,\n or while printing.\n \n Implementations are free to ignore\
            \ the hints completely, but should\n try to use an implementation algorithm\
            \ that is as close as possible\n to the request.\n If an implementation\
            \ supports a given algorithm when any value is used\n for an associated\
            \ hint key, then minimally it must do so when the\n value for that key\
            \ is the exact value that specifies the algorithm.\n \n The keys used\
            \ to control the hints are all special values that\n subclass the associated\
            \ RenderingHints.Key class.\n Many common hints are expressed below as\
            \ static constants in this\n class, but the list is not meant to be exhaustive.\n\
            \ Other hints may be created by other packages by defining new objects\n\
            \ which subclass the Key class and defining the associated values."

                \ be stored into a destination, it\n must first convert that color\

                \ surface.\n Minimally, the color components must be converted to\

                \ takes into account the sub-pixel\n accuracy of the scaled character\
                \ advances of the font or whether\n such advance vectors are rounded\
                \ to an integer number of whole\n device pixels.\n This hint only\
                \ recommends how much accuracy should be used to\n position the glyphs\
                \ and does not specify or recommend whether or\n not the actual rasterization\
                \ or pixel bounds of the glyph should\n be modified to match.\n \n\
                \ Rendering text to a low resolution device like a screen will\n necessarily\
                \ involve a number of rounding operations as the\n high quality and\
                \ very precise definition of the shape and\n metrics of the character\
                \ glyphs must be matched to discrete\n device pixels.\n Ideally the\
                \ positioning of glyphs during text layout would be\n calculated by\
                \ scaling the design metrics in the font according\n to the point\
                \ size, but then the scaled advance width will not\n necessarily be\
                \ an integer number of pixels.\n If the glyphs are positioned with\
                \ sub-pixel accuracy according\n to these scaled design metrics then\
                \ the rasterization would\n ideally need to be adjusted for each possible\
                \ sub-pixel origin.\n \n Unfortunately, scaling each glyph customized\
                \ to its exact\n subpixel origin during text layout would be prohibitively\n\
                \ expensive so a simplified system based on integer device\n positions\
                \ is typically used to lay out the text.\n The rasterization of the\
                \ glyph and the scaled advance width\n are both adjusted together\
                \ to yield text that looks good at\n device resolution and has consistent\
                \ integer pixel distances\n between glyphs that help the glyphs look\
                \ uniformly and\n consistently spaced and readable.\n \n This process\
                \ of rounding advance widths for rasterized glyphs\n to integer distances\
                \ means that the character density and the\n overall length of a string\
                \ of text will be different from the\n theoretical design measurements\
                \ due to the accumulation of\n a series of small differences in the\
                \ adjusted widths of\n each glyph.\n The specific differences will\
                \ be different for each glyph,\n some being wider and some being narrower\
                \ than their theoretical\n design measurements.\n Thus the overall\
                \ difference in character density and length\n will vary by a number\
                \ of factors including the font, the\n specific device resolution\
                \ being targeted, and the glyphs\n chosen to represent the string\
                \ being rendered.\n As a result, rendering the same string at multiple\
                \ device\n resolutions can yield widely varying metrics for whole\
                \ strings.\n \n When FRACTIONALMETRICS are enabled, the true font\
                \ design\n metrics are scaled by the point size and used for layout\
                \ with\n sub-pixel accuracy.\n The average density of glyphs and total\
                \ length of a long\n string of characters will therefore more closely\
                \ match the\n theoretical design of the font, but readability may\
                \ be affected\n since individual pairs of characters may not always\
                \ appear to\n be consistent distances apart depending on how the sub-pixel\n\
                \ accumulation of the glyph origins meshes with the device pixel\n\
                \ grid.\n Enabling this hint may be desirable when text layout is\
                \ being\n performed that must be consistent across a wide variety\
                \ of\n output resolutions.\n Specifically, this hint may be desirable\
                \ in situations where\n the layout of text is being previewed on a\
                \ low resolution\n device like a screen for output that will eventually\
                \ be\n rendered on a high resolution printer or typesetting device.\n\
                \ \n When disabled, the scaled design metrics are rounded or adjusted\n\
                \ to integer distances for layout.\n The distances between any specific\
                \ pair of glyphs will be more\n uniform on the device, but the density\
                \ and total length of long\n strings may no longer match the theoretical\
                \ intentions of the\n font designer.\n Disabling this hint will typically\
                \ produce more readable results\n on low resolution devices like computer\
