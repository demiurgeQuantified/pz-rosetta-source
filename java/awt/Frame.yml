          notes: "A Frame is a top-level window with a title and a border.\n \n The\
            \ size of the frame includes any area designated for the\n border.  The\
            \ dimensions of the border area may be obtained\n using the getInsets\
            \ method, however, since\n these dimensions are platform-dependent, a\
            \ valid insets\n value cannot be obtained until the frame is made displayable\n\
            \ by either calling pack or show.\n Since the border area is included\
            \ in the overall size of the\n frame, the border effectively obscures\
            \ a portion of the frame,\n constraining the area available for rendering\
            \ and/or displaying\n subcomponents to the rectangle which has an upper-left\
            \ corner\n location of (insets.left, insets.top), and has a size of\n\
            \ width - (insets.left + insets.right) by\n height - (insets.top + insets.bottom).\n\
            \ \n The default layout for a frame is BorderLayout.\n \n A frame may\
            \ have its native decorations (i.e. Frame\n and Titlebar) turned off\n\
            \ with setUndecorated. This can only be done while the frame\n is not\
            \ displayable.\n \n In a multi-screen environment, you can create a Frame\n\
            \ on a different screen device by constructing the Frame\n with Frame(GraphicsConfiguration)\
            \ or\n Frame(String title, GraphicsConfiguration).  The\n GraphicsConfiguration\
            \ object is one of the\n GraphicsConfiguration objects of the target screen\n\
            \ device.\n \n In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the\
            \ desktop\n area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds\
            \ of all\n configurations are relative to the virtual-coordinate system.\
            \  The\n origin of the virtual-coordinate system is at the upper left-hand\n\
            \ corner of the primary physical screen.  Depending on the location\n\
            \ of the primary screen in the virtual device, negative coordinates\n\
            \ are possible, as shown in the following figure.\n \n \n \n In such an\
            \ environment, when calling setLocation,\n you must pass a virtual coordinate\
            \ to this method.  Similarly,\n calling getLocationOnScreen on a Frame\n\
            \ returns virtual device coordinates.  Call the getBounds\n method of\
            \ a GraphicsConfiguration to find its origin in\n the virtual coordinate\
            \ system.\n \n The following code sets the\n location of the Frame at\
            \ (10, 10) relative\n to the origin of the physical screen of the corresponding\n\
            \ GraphicsConfiguration.  If the bounds of the\n GraphicsConfiguration\
            \ is not taken into account, the\n Frame location would be set at (10,\
            \ 10) relative to the\n virtual-coordinate system and would appear on\
            \ the primary physical\n screen, which might be different from the physical\
            \ screen of the\n specified GraphicsConfiguration.\n\n \n      Frame f\
            \ = new Frame(GraphicsConfiguration gc);\n      Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds();\n\
            \      f.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y);\n \n\n \n Frames are\
            \ capable of generating the following types of\n WindowEvents:\n \n WINDOW_OPENED\n\
            \ WINDOW_CLOSING:\n     If the program doesn't\n     explicitly hide or\
            \ dispose the window while processing\n     this event, the window close\
            \ operation is canceled.\n WINDOW_CLOSED\n WINDOW_ICONIFIED\n WINDOW_DEICONIFIED\n\
            \ WINDOW_ACTIVATED\n WINDOW_DEACTIVATED\n WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS\n WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS\n\
            \ WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED"
