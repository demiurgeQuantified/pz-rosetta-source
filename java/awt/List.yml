          notes: "The List component presents the user with a\n scrolling list of\
            \ text items. The list can be set up so that\n the user can choose either\
            \ one item or multiple items.\n \n For example, the code . . .\n\n \n\
            \ List lst = new List(4, false);\n lst.add(\"Mercury\");\n lst.add(\"\
            Venus\");\n lst.add(\"Earth\");\n lst.add(\"JavaSoft\");\n lst.add(\"\
            Mars\");\n lst.add(\"Jupiter\");\n lst.add(\"Saturn\");\n lst.add(\"Uranus\"\
            );\n lst.add(\"Neptune\");\n lst.add(\"Pluto\");\n cnt.add(lst);\n \n\
            \ \n where cnt is a container, produces the following\n scrolling list:\n\
            \ \n \n \n If the List allows multiple selections, then clicking on\n\
            \ an item that is already selected deselects it. In the preceding\n example,\
            \ only one item from the scrolling list can be selected\n at a time, since\
            \ the second argument when creating the new scrolling\n list is false.\
            \ If the List does not allow multiple\n selections, selecting an item\
            \ causes any other selected item\n to be deselected.\n \n Note that the\
            \ list in the example shown was created with four visible\n rows.  Once\
            \ the list has been created, the number of visible rows\n cannot be changed.\
            \  A default List is created with\n four rows, so that lst = new List()\
            \ is equivalent to\n list = new List(4, false).\n \n Beginning with Java\
            \ 1.1, the Abstract Window Toolkit\n sends the List object all mouse,\
            \ keyboard, and focus events\n that occur over it. (The old AWT event\
            \ model is being maintained\n only for backwards compatibility, and its\
            \ use is discouraged.)\n \n When an item is selected or deselected by\
            \ the user, AWT sends an instance\n of ItemEvent to the list.\n When the\
            \ user double-clicks on an item in a scrolling list,\n AWT sends an instance\
            \ of ActionEvent to the\n list following the item event. AWT also generates\
            \ an action event\n when the user presses the return key while an item\
            \ in the\n list is selected.\n \n If an application wants to perform some\
            \ action based on an item\n in this list being selected or activated by\
            \ the user, it should implement\n ItemListener or ActionListener\n as\
            \ appropriate and register the new listener to receive\n events from this\
            \ list.\n \n For multiple-selection scrolling lists, it is considered\
            \ a better\n user interface to use an external gesture (such as clicking\
            \ on a\n button) to trigger the action."
