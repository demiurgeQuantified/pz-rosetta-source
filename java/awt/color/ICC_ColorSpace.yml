          notes: "The ICC_ColorSpace class is an implementation of the abstract\n\
            \ ColorSpace class. This representation of device independent and\n device\
            \ dependent color spaces is based on the International Color Consortium\n\
            \ Specification ICC.1:2001-12, File Format for Color Profiles (see\n http://www.color.org).\n\
            \ \n Typically, a Color or ColorModel would be associated with an\n ICC\
            \ Profile which is either an input, display, or output profile (see the\
            \ ICC\n specification). There are other types of ICC Profiles, e.g. abstract\n\
            \ profiles, device link profiles, and named color profiles, which do not\n\
            \ contain information appropriate for representing the color space of\
            \ a color,\n image, or device (see ICC_Profile). Attempting to create\
            \ an\n ICC_ColorSpace object from an inappropriate ICC Profile is an error.\n\
            \ \n ICC Profiles represent transformations from the color space of the\
            \ profile\n (e.g. a monitor) to a Profile Connection Space (PCS). Profiles\
            \ of interest\n for tagging images or colors have a PCS which is one of\
            \ the device\n independent spaces (one CIEXYZ space and two CIELab spaces)\
            \ defined in the\n ICC Profile Format Specification. Most profiles of\
            \ interest either have\n invertible transformations or explicitly specify\
            \ transformations going both\n directions. Should an ICC_ColorSpace object\
            \ be used in a way\n requiring a conversion from PCS to the profile's\
            \ native space and there is\n inadequate data to correctly perform the\
            \ conversion, the\n ICC_ColorSpace object will produce output in the specified\
            \ type of\n color space (e.g. TYPE_RGB, TYPE_CMYK, etc.), but the\n specific\
            \ color values of the output data will be undefined.\n \n The details\
            \ of this class are not important for simple applets, which draw in\n\
            \ a default color space or manipulate and display imported images with\
            \ a known\n color space. At most, such applets would need to get one of\
            \ the default color\n spaces via ColorSpace.getInstance(int)."

            notes: "Transforms a color value assumed to be in the CS_CIEXYZ\n conversion\
              \ color space into this ColorSpace.\n \n This method transforms color\
              \ values using relative colorimetry, as\n defined by the ICC Specification.\
              \ This means that the XYZ argument values\n taken by this method are\
              \ represented relative to the D50 white point of\n the CS_CIEXYZ color\
              \ space. This representation is useful in a\n two-step color conversion\
              \ process in which colors are transformed from an\n input color space\
              \ to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.\n The color values\
              \ returned by this method are not those that would produce\n the XYZ\
              \ value passed to the method when measured by a colorimeter. If you\n\
              \ have XYZ values corresponding to measurements made using current CIE\n\
              \ recommended practices, they must be converted to D50 relative values\n\
              \ before being passed to this method. The paragraphs below explain this\
              \ in\n more detail.\n \n The ICC standard uses a device independent\
              \ color space (DICS) as the\n mechanism for converting color from one\
              \ device to another device. In this\n architecture, colors are converted\
              \ from the source device's color space\n to the ICC DICS and then from\
              \ the ICC DICS to the destination device's\n color space. The ICC standard\
              \ defines device profiles which contain\n transforms which will convert\
              \ between a device's color space and the ICC\n DICS. The overall conversion\
              \ of colors from a source device to colors of\n a destination device\
              \ is done by connecting the device-to-DICS transform\n of the profile\
              \ for the source device to the DICS-to-device transform of\n the profile\
              \ for the destination device. For this reason, the ICC DICS is\n commonly\
              \ referred to as the profile connection space (PCS). The color\n space\
              \ used in the methods toCIEXYZ and fromCIEXYZ is the\n CIEXYZ PCS defined\
              \ by the ICC Specification. This is also the color space\n represented\
              \ by ColorSpace.CS_CIEXYZ.\n \n The XYZ values of a color are often\
              \ represented as relative to some white\n point, so the actual meaning\
              \ of the XYZ values cannot be known without\n knowing the white point\
              \ of those values. This is known as relative\n colorimetry. The PCS\
              \ uses a white point of D50, so the XYZ values of the\n PCS are relative\
              \ to D50. For example, white in the PCS will have the XYZ\n values of\
              \ D50, which is defined to be X=.9642, Y=1.000, and Z=0.8249.\n This\
              \ white point is commonly used for graphic arts applications, but\n\
              \ others are often used in other applications.\n \n To quantify the\
              \ color characteristics of a device such as a printer or\n monitor,\
              \ measurements of XYZ values for particular device colors are\n typically\
              \ made. For purposes of this discussion, the term device XYZ\n values\
              \ is used to mean the XYZ values that would be measured from device\n\
              \ colors using current CIE recommended practices.\n \n Converting between\
              \ device XYZ values and the PCS XYZ values taken as\n arguments by this\
              \ method corresponds to converting between the device's\n color space,\
              \ as represented by CIE colorimetric values, and the PCS.\n There are\
              \ many factors involved in this process, some of which are quite\n subtle.\
              \ The most important, however, is the adjustment made to account\n for\
              \ differences between the device's white point and the white point of\n\
              \ the PCS. There are many techniques for doing this and it is the subject\n\
              \ of much current research and controversy. Some commonly used methods\
              \ are\n XYZ scaling, the von Kries transform, and the Bradford transform.\
              \ The\n proper method to use depends upon each particular application.\n\
              \ \n The simplest method is XYZ scaling. In this method each device\
              \ XYZ value\n is converted to a PCS XYZ value by multiplying it by the\
              \ ratio of the PCS\n white point (D50) to the device white point.\n\
              \ \n\n Xd, Yd, Zd are the device XYZ values\n Xdw, Ydw, Zdw are the\
              \ device XYZ white point values\n Xp, Yp, Zp are the PCS XYZ values\n\
              \ Xd50, Yd50, Zd50 are the PCS XYZ white point values\n\n Xp = Xd *\
              \ (Xd50 / Xdw)\n Yp = Yd * (Yd50 / Ydw)\n Zp = Zd * (Zd50 / Zdw)\n\n\
              \ \n \n Conversion from the PCS to the device would be done by inverting\
              \ these\n equations:\n \n\n Xd = Xp * (Xdw / Xd50)\n Yd = Yp * (Ydw\
              \ / Yd50)\n Zd = Zp * (Zdw / Zd50)\n\n \n \n Note that the media white\
              \ point tag in an ICC profile is not the same as\n the device white\
              \ point. The media white point tag is expressed in PCS\n values and\
              \ is used to represent the difference between the XYZ of device\n illuminant\
              \ and the XYZ of the device media when measured under that\n illuminant.\
              \ The device white point is expressed as the device XYZ values\n corresponding\
              \ to white displayed on the device. For example, displaying\n the RGB\
              \ color (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) on an sRGB device will result in a measured\n\
              \ device XYZ value of D65. This will not be the same as the media white\n\
              \ point tag XYZ value in the ICC profile for an sRGB device."

              \ in which colors are transformed from an\n input color space to CS_CIEXYZ\
              \ and then to an output color space.\n This representation is not the\
              \ same as the XYZ values that would be\n measured from the given color\
              \ value by a colorimeter. A further\n transformation is necessary to\
              \ compute the XYZ values that would be\n measured using current CIE\
              \ recommended practices. The paragraphs below\n explain this in more\
              \ detail.\n \n The ICC standard uses a device independent color space\
              \ (DICS) as the\n mechanism for converting color from one device to\
              \ another device. In this\n architecture, colors are converted from\
              \ the source device's color space\n to the ICC DICS and then from the\
              \ ICC DICS to the destination device's\n color space. The ICC standard\
              \ defines device profiles which contain\n transforms which will convert\
              \ between a device's color space and the ICC\n DICS. The overall conversion\
              \ of colors from a source device to colors of\n a destination device\
              \ is done by connecting the device-to-DICS transform\n of the profile\
              \ for the source device to the DICS-to-device transform of\n the profile\
              \ for the destination device. For this reason, the ICC DICS is\n commonly\
              \ referred to as the profile connection space (PCS). The color\n space\
              \ used in the methods toCIEXYZ and fromCIEXYZ is the\n CIEXYZ PCS defined\
              \ by the ICC Specification. This is also the color space\n represented\
              \ by ColorSpace.CS_CIEXYZ.\n \n The XYZ values of a color are often\
              \ represented as relative to some white\n point, so the actual meaning\
              \ of the XYZ values cannot be known without\n knowing the white point\
              \ of those values. This is known as relative\n colorimetry. The PCS\
              \ uses a white point of D50, so the XYZ values of the\n PCS are relative\
              \ to D50. For example, white in the PCS will have the XYZ\n values of\
              \ D50, which is defined to be X=.9642, Y=1.000, and Z=0.8249.\n This\
              \ white point is commonly used for graphic arts applications, but\n\
              \ others are often used in other applications.\n \n To quantify the\
              \ color characteristics of a device such as a printer or\n monitor,\
              \ measurements of XYZ values for particular device colors are\n typically\
              \ made. For purposes of this discussion, the term device XYZ\n values\
              \ is used to mean the XYZ values that would be measured from device\n\
              \ colors using current CIE recommended practices.\n \n Converting between\
              \ device XYZ values and the PCS XYZ values returned by\n this method\
              \ corresponds to converting between the device's color space,\n as represented\
              \ by CIE colorimetric values, and the PCS. There are many\n factors\
              \ involved in this process, some of which are quite subtle. The\n most\
              \ important, however, is the adjustment made to account for\n differences\
              \ between the device's white point and the white point of the\n PCS.\
              \ There are many techniques for doing this and it is the subject of\n\
              \ much current research and controversy. Some commonly used methods\
              \ are XYZ\n scaling, the von Kries transform, and the Bradford transform.\
              \ The proper\n method to use depends upon each particular application.\n\
              \ \n The simplest method is XYZ scaling. In this method each device\
              \ XYZ value\n is converted to a PCS XYZ value by multiplying it by the\
              \ ratio of the PCS\n white point (D50) to the device white point.\n\
              \ \n\n Xd, Yd, Zd are the device XYZ values\n Xdw, Ydw, Zdw are the\
              \ device XYZ white point values\n Xp, Yp, Zp are the PCS XYZ values\n\
              \ Xd50, Yd50, Zd50 are the PCS XYZ white point values\n\n Xp = Xd *\
              \ (Xd50 / Xdw)\n Yp = Yd * (Yd50 / Ydw)\n Zp = Zd * (Zd50 / Zdw)\n\n\
              \ \n \n Conversion from the PCS to the device would be done by inverting\
              \ these\n equations:\n \n\n Xd = Xp * (Xdw / Xd50)\n Yd = Yp * (Ydw\
              \ / Yd50)\n Zd = Zp * (Zdw / Zd50)\n\n \n \n Note that the media white\
              \ point tag in an ICC profile is not the same as\n the device white\
              \ point. The media white point tag is expressed in PCS\n values and\
              \ is used to represent the difference between the XYZ of device\n illuminant\
              \ and the XYZ of the device media when measured under that\n illuminant.\
              \ The device white point is expressed as the device XYZ values\n corresponding\
              \ to white displayed on the device. For example, displaying\n the RGB\
              \ color (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) on an sRGB device will result in a measured\n\
              \ device XYZ value of D65. This will not be the same as the media white\n\
              \ point tag XYZ value in the ICC profile for an sRGB device."
