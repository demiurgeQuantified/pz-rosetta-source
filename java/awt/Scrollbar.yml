          notes: "The Scrollbar class embodies a scroll bar, a\n familiar user-interface\
            \ object. A scroll bar provides a\n convenient means for allowing a user\
            \ to select from a\n range of values. The following three vertical\n scroll\
            \ bars could be used as slider controls to pick\n the red, green, and\
            \ blue components of a color:\n \n \n \n Each scroll bar in this example\
            \ could be created with\n code similar to the following:\n\n \n redSlider=new\
            \ Scrollbar(Scrollbar.VERTICAL, 0, 1, 0, 255);\n add(redSlider);\n \n\
            \ \n Alternatively, a scroll bar can represent a range of values. For\n\
            \ example, if a scroll bar is used for scrolling through text, the\n width\
            \ of the \"bubble\" (also called the \"thumb\" or \"scroll box\")\n can\
            \ be used to represent the amount of text that is visible.\n Here is an\
            \ example of a scroll bar that represents a range:\n \n \n \n The value\
            \ range represented by the bubble in this example\n is the visible amount.\
            \ The horizontal scroll bar\n in this example could be created with code\
            \ like the following:\n\n \n ranger = new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL,\
            \ 0, 60, 0, 300);\n add(ranger);\n \n \n Note that the actual maximum\
            \ value of the scroll bar is the\n maximum minus the visible amount.\n\
            \ In the previous example, because the maximum is\n 300 and the visible\
            \ amount is 60, the actual maximum\n value is 240.  The range of the scrollbar\
            \ track is 0 - 300.\n The left side of the bubble indicates the value\
            \ of the\n scroll bar.\n \n Normally, the user changes the value of the\
            \ scroll bar by\n making a gesture with the mouse. For example, the user\
            \ can\n drag the scroll bar's bubble up and down, or click in the\n scroll\
            \ bar's unit increment or block increment areas. Keyboard\n gestures can\
            \ also be mapped to the scroll bar. By convention,\n the Page Up and Page\
            \ Down\n keys are equivalent to clicking in the scroll bar's block\n increment\
            \ and block decrement areas.\n \n When the user changes the value of the\
            \ scroll bar, the scroll bar\n receives an instance of AdjustmentEvent.\n\
            \ The scroll bar processes this event, passing it along to\n any registered\
            \ listeners.\n \n Any object that wishes to be notified of changes to\
            \ the\n scroll bar's value should implement\n AdjustmentListener, an interface\
            \ defined in\n the package java.awt.event.\n Listeners can be added and\
            \ removed dynamically by calling\n the methods addAdjustmentListener and\n\
            \ removeAdjustmentListener.\n \n The AdjustmentEvent class defines five\
            \ types\n of adjustment event, listed here:\n\n \n AdjustmentEvent.TRACK\
            \ is sent out when the\n user drags the scroll bar's bubble.\n AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_INCREMENT\
            \ is sent out\n when the user clicks in the left arrow of a horizontal\
            \ scroll\n bar, or the top arrow of a vertical scroll bar, or makes the\n\
            \ equivalent gesture from the keyboard.\n AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_DECREMENT\
            \ is sent out\n when the user clicks in the right arrow of a horizontal\
            \ scroll\n bar, or the bottom arrow of a vertical scroll bar, or makes\
            \ the\n equivalent gesture from the keyboard.\n AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_INCREMENT\
            \ is sent out\n when the user clicks in the track, to the left of the\
            \ bubble\n on a horizontal scroll bar, or above the bubble on a vertical\n\
            \ scroll bar. By convention, the Page Up\n key is equivalent, if the user\
            \ is using a keyboard that\n defines a Page Up key.\n AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_DECREMENT\
            \ is sent out\n when the user clicks in the track, to the right of the\
            \ bubble\n on a horizontal scroll bar, or below the bubble on a vertical\n\
            \ scroll bar. By convention, the Page Down\n key is equivalent, if the\
            \ user is using a keyboard that\n defines a Page Down key.\n \n \n The\
            \ JDK 1.0 event system is supported for backwards\n compatibility, but\
            \ its use with newer versions of the platform is\n discouraged. The five\
            \ types of adjustment events introduced\n with JDK 1.1 correspond to the\
            \ five event types\n that are associated with scroll bars in previous\
            \ platform versions.\n The following list gives the adjustment event type,\n\
            \ and the corresponding JDK 1.0 event type it replaces.\n\n \n AdjustmentEvent.TRACK\
            \ replaces\n Event.SCROLL_ABSOLUTE\n AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_INCREMENT replaces\n\
            \ Event.SCROLL_LINE_UP\n AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_DECREMENT replaces\n Event.SCROLL_LINE_DOWN\n\
            \ AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_INCREMENT replaces\n Event.SCROLL_PAGE_UP\n AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_DECREMENT\
            \ replaces\n Event.SCROLL_PAGE_DOWN\n \n \n Note: We recommend using a\
            \ Scrollbar\n for value selection only.  If you want to implement\n a\
            \ scrollable component inside a container, we recommend you use\n a ScrollPane.\
            \ If you use a\n Scrollbar for this purpose, you are likely to\n encounter\
            \ issues with painting, key handling, sizing and\n positioning."

              \ size of the scroll bar's\n bubble (also called a thumb or scroll box),\
              \ usually gives a\n visual representation of the relationship of the\
              \ visible\n amount to the range of the scroll bar.\n Note that depending\
              \ on platform, the value of the visible amount property\n may not be\
              \ visually indicated by the size of the bubble.\n \n The scroll bar's\
              \ bubble may not be displayed when it is not\n moveable (e.g. when it\
              \ takes up the entire length of the\n scroll bar's track, or when the\
              \ scroll bar is disabled).\n Whether the bubble is displayed or not\
              \ will not affect\n the value returned by getVisibleAmount.\n \n If\
              \ the visible amount supplied is less than one\n or greater than the\
              \ current maximum - minimum,\n then either one or maximum - minimum\n\
              \ is substituted, as appropriate.\n \n Normally, a program should change\
              \ a scroll bar's\n value only by calling setValues.\n The setValues\
              \ method simultaneously\n and synchronously sets the minimum, maximum,\
              \ visible amount,\n and value properties of a scroll bar, so that they\
              \ are\n mutually consistent."
