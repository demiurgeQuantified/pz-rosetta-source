          notes: "Modal dialogs block all input to some top-level windows.\n Whether\
            \ a particular window is blocked depends on dialog's type\n of modality;\
            \ this is called the \"scope of blocking\". The\n ModalityType enum specifies\
            \ modal types and their\n associated scopes."

                \ A document is a top-level window without an owner. It may contain\
                \ child\n windows that, together with the top-level window are treated\
                \ as a single\n solid document. Since every top-level window must\
                \ belong to some\n document, its root can be found as the top-nearest\
