          notes: "This class creates a labeled button. The application can cause\n\
            \ some action to happen when the button is pushed. This image\n depicts\
            \ three views of a \"Quit\" button as it appears\n under the Solaris operating\
            \ system:\n \n \n \n The first view shows the button as it appears normally.\n\
            \ The second view shows the button\n when it has input focus. Its outline\
            \ is darkened to let the\n user know that it is an active object. The\
            \ third view shows the\n button when the user clicks the mouse over the\
            \ button, and thus\n requests that an action be performed.\n \n The gesture\
            \ of clicking on a button with the mouse\n is associated with one instance\
            \ of ActionEvent,\n which is sent out when the mouse is both pressed and\
            \ released\n over the button. If an application is interested in knowing\n\
            \ when the button has been pressed but not released, as a separate\n gesture,\
            \ it can specialize processMouseEvent,\n or it can register itself as\
            \ a listener for mouse events by\n calling addMouseListener. Both of these\
            \ methods are\n defined by Component, the abstract superclass of\n all\
            \ components.\n \n When a button is pressed and released, AWT sends an\
            \ instance\n of ActionEvent to the button, by calling\n processEvent on\
            \ the button. The button's\n processEvent method receives all events\n\
            \ for the button; it passes an action event along by\n calling its own\
            \ processActionEvent method.\n The latter method passes the action event\
            \ on to any action\n listeners that have registered an interest in action\n\
            \ events generated by this button.\n \n If an application wants to perform\
            \ some action based on\n a button being pressed and released, it should\
            \ implement\n ActionListener and register the new listener\n to receive\
            \ events from this button, by calling the button's\n addActionListener\
            \ method. The application can\n make use of the button's action command\
            \ as a messaging protocol."
