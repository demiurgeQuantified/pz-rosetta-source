          notes: "A Dialog is a top-level window with a title and a border\n that\
            \ is typically used to take some form of input from the user.\n\n The\
            \ size of the dialog includes any area designated for the\n border.  The\
            \ dimensions of the border area can be obtained\n using the getInsets\
            \ method, however, since\n these dimensions are platform-dependent, a\
            \ valid insets\n value cannot be obtained until the dialog is made displayable\n\
            \ by either calling pack or show.\n Since the border area is included\
            \ in the overall size of the\n dialog, the border effectively obscures\
            \ a portion of the dialog,\n constraining the area available for rendering\
            \ and/or displaying\n subcomponents to the rectangle which has an upper-left\
            \ corner\n location of (insets.left, insets.top), and has a size of\n\
            \ width - (insets.left + insets.right) by\n height - (insets.top + insets.bottom).\n\
            \ \n The default layout for a dialog is BorderLayout.\n \n A dialog may\
            \ have its native decorations (i.e. Frame & Titlebar) turned off\n with\
            \ setUndecorated.  This can only be done while the dialog\n is not displayable.\n\
            \ \n A dialog may have another window as its owner when it's constructed.\
            \  When\n the owner window of a visible dialog is minimized, the dialog\
            \ will\n automatically be hidden from the user. When the owner window\
            \ is subsequently\n restored, the dialog is made visible to the user again.\n\
            \ \n In a multi-screen environment, you can create a Dialog\n on a different\
            \ screen device than its owner.  See Frame for\n more information.\n \n\
            \ A dialog can be either modeless (the default) or modal.  A modal\n dialog\
            \ is one which blocks input to some other top-level windows\n in the application,\
            \ except for any windows created with the dialog\n as their owner. See\
            \ AWT Modality\n specification for details.\n \n Dialogs are capable of\
            \ generating the following\n WindowEvents:\n WindowOpened, WindowClosing,\n\
            \ WindowClosed, WindowActivated,\n WindowDeactivated, WindowGainedFocus,\n\
            \ WindowLostFocus."
