          notes: "The Polygon class encapsulates a description of a\n closed, two-dimensional\
            \ region within a coordinate space. This\n region is bounded by an arbitrary\
            \ number of line segments, each of\n which is one side of the polygon.\
            \ Internally, a polygon\n comprises of a list of (x,y)\n coordinate pairs,\
            \ where each pair defines a vertex of the\n polygon, and two successive\
            \ pairs are the endpoints of a\n line that is a side of the polygon. The\
            \ first and final\n pairs of (x,y) points are joined by a line segment\n\
            \ that closes the polygon.  This Polygon is defined with\n an even-odd\
            \ winding rule.  See\n WIND_EVEN_ODD\n for a definition of the even-odd\
            \ winding rule.\n This class's hit-testing methods, which include the\n\
            \ contains, intersects and inside\n methods, use the insideness definition\
            \ described in the\n Shape class comments."
