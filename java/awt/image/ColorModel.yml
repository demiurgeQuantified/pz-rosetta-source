          notes: "The ColorModel abstract class encapsulates the\n methods for translating\
            \ a pixel value to color components\n (for example, red, green, and blue)\
            \ and an alpha component.\n In order to render an image to the screen,\
            \ a printer, or another\n image, pixel values must be converted to color\
            \ and alpha components.\n As arguments to or return values from methods\
            \ of this class,\n pixels are represented as 32-bit ints or as arrays\
            \ of primitive types.\n The number, order, and interpretation of color\
            \ components for a\n ColorModel is specified by its ColorSpace.\n A ColorModel\
            \ used with pixel data that does not include\n alpha information treats\
            \ all pixels as opaque, which is an alpha\n value of 1.0.\n \n This ColorModel\
            \ class supports two representations of\n pixel values.  A pixel value\
            \ can be a single 32-bit int or an\n array of primitive types.  The Java(tm)\
            \ Platform 1.0 and 1.1 APIs\n represented pixels as single byte or single\n\
            \ int values.  For purposes of the ColorModel\n class, pixel value arguments\
            \ were passed as ints.  The Java(tm) 2\n Platform API introduced additional\
            \ classes for representing images.\n With BufferedImage or RenderedImage\n\
            \ objects, based on Raster and SampleModel classes, pixel\n values might\
            \ not be conveniently representable as a single int.\n Consequently, ColorModel\
            \ now has methods that accept\n pixel values represented as arrays of\
            \ primitive types.  The primitive\n type used by a particular ColorModel\
            \ object is called its\n transfer type.\n \n ColorModel objects used with\
            \ images for which pixel values\n are not conveniently representable as\
            \ a single int throw an\n IllegalArgumentException when methods taking\
            \ a single int pixel\n argument are called.  Subclasses of ColorModel\
            \ must\n specify the conditions under which this occurs.  This does not\n\
            \ occur with DirectColorModel or IndexColorModel objects.\n \n Currently,\
            \ the transfer types supported by the Java 2D(tm) API are\n DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE,\
            \ DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_INT,\n DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT,\
            \ DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE.\n Most rendering\
            \ operations will perform much faster when using ColorModels\n and images\
            \ based on the first three of these types.  In addition, some\n image\
            \ filtering operations are not supported for ColorModels and\n images\
            \ based on the latter three types.\n The transfer type for a particular\
            \ ColorModel object is\n specified when the object is created, either\
            \ explicitly or by default.\n All subclasses of ColorModel must specify\
            \ what the\n possible transfer types are and how the number of elements\
            \ in the\n primitive arrays representing pixels is determined.\n \n For\
            \ BufferedImages, the transfer type of its\n Raster and of the Raster\
            \ object's\n SampleModel (available from the\n getTransferType methods\
            \ of these classes) must match that\n of the ColorModel.  The number of\
            \ elements in an array\n representing a pixel for the Raster and\n SampleModel\
            \ (available from the\n getNumDataElements methods of these classes) must\
            \ match\n that of the ColorModel.\n \n The algorithm used to convert from\
            \ pixel values to color and alpha\n components varies by subclass.  For\
            \ example, there is not necessarily\n a one-to-one correspondence between\
            \ samples obtained from the\n SampleModel of a BufferedImage object's\n\
            \ Raster and color/alpha components.  Even when\n there is such a correspondence,\
            \ the number of bits in a sample is not\n necessarily the same as the\
            \ number of bits in the corresponding color/alpha\n component.  Each subclass\
            \ must specify how the translation from\n pixel values to color/alpha\
            \ components is done.\n \n Methods in the ColorModel class use two different\n\
            \ representations of color and alpha components - a normalized form\n\
            \ and an unnormalized form.  In the normalized form, each component is\
            \ a\n float value between some minimum and maximum values.  For\n the\
            \ alpha component, the minimum is 0.0 and the maximum is 1.0.  For\n color\
            \ components the minimum and maximum values for each component can\n be\
            \ obtained from the ColorSpace object.  These values\n will often be 0.0\
            \ and 1.0 (e.g. normalized component values for the\n default sRGB color\
            \ space range from 0.0 to 1.0), but some color spaces\n have component\
            \ values with different upper and lower limits.  These\n limits can be\
            \ obtained using the getMinValue and\n getMaxValue methods of the ColorSpace\n\
            \ class.  Normalized color component values are not premultiplied.\n All\
            \ ColorModels must support the normalized form.\n \n In the unnormalized\n\
            \ form, each component is an unsigned integral value between 0 and\n 2n\
            \ - 1, where n is the number of significant bits for a\n particular component.\
            \  If pixel values for a particular\n ColorModel represent color samples\
            \ premultiplied by\n the alpha sample, unnormalized color component values\
            \ are\n also premultiplied.  The unnormalized form is used only with instances\n\
            \ of ColorModel whose ColorSpace has minimum\n component values of 0.0\
            \ for all components and maximum values of\n 1.0 for all components.\n\
            \ The unnormalized form for color and alpha components can be a convenient\n\
            \ representation for ColorModels whose normalized component\n values all\
            \ lie\n between 0.0 and 1.0.  In such cases the integral value 0 maps\
            \ to 0.0 and\n the value 2n - 1 maps to 1.0.  In other cases, such as\n\
            \ when the normalized component values can be either negative or positive,\n\
            \ the unnormalized form is not convenient.  Such ColorModel\n objects\
            \ throw an IllegalArgumentException when methods involving\n an unnormalized\
            \ argument are called.  Subclasses of ColorModel\n must specify the conditions\
            \ under which this occurs."

              \ interfaces for the convenience of the programmer.\n The color space\
              \ is the default ColorSpace, sRGB.\n The format for the RGB values is\
              \ an integer with 8 bits\n each of alpha, red, green, and blue color\
              \ components ordered\n correspondingly from the most significant byte\
              \ to the least\n significant byte, as in:  0xAARRGGBB.  Color components\
              \ are\n not premultiplied by the alpha component.  This format does\
              \ not\n necessarily represent the native or the most efficient\n ColorModel\
              \ for a particular device or for all images.\n It is merely used as\
              \ a common color model format."
