          notes: "The BufferedImage subclass describes an Image with an accessible\
            \ buffer of image data.\n A BufferedImage is comprised of a ColorModel\
            \ and a\n Raster of image data.\n The number and types of bands in the\
            \ SampleModel of the\n Raster must match the number and types required\
            \ by the\n ColorModel to represent its color and alpha components.\n All\
            \ BufferedImage objects have an upper left corner\n coordinate of (0,\
            \ 0).  Any Raster used to construct a\n BufferedImage must therefore have\
            \ minX=0 and minY=0.\n\n \n This class relies on the data fetching and\
            \ setting methods\n of Raster,\n and on the color characterization methods\
            \ of ColorModel."
