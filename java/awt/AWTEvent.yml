          notes: "The root event class for all AWT events.\n This class and its subclasses\
            \ supersede the original\n java.awt.Event class.\n Subclasses of this\
            \ root AWTEvent class defined outside of the\n java.awt.event package\
            \ should define event ID values greater than\n the value defined by RESERVED_ID_MAX.\n\
            \ \n The event masks defined in this class are needed by Component subclasses\n\
            \ which are using Component.enableEvents() to select for event types not\n\
            \ selected by registered listeners. If a listener is registered on a\n\
            \ component, the appropriate event mask is already set internally by the\n\
            \ component.\n \n The masks are also used to specify to which types of\
            \ events an\n AWTEventListener should listen. The masks are bitwise-ORed\
            \ together\n and passed to Toolkit.addAWTEventListener."
