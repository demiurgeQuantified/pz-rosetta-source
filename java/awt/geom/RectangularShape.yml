          notes: "RectangularShape is the base class for a number of\n Shape objects\
            \ whose geometry is defined by a rectangular frame.\n This class does\
            \ not directly specify any specific geometry by\n itself, but merely provides\
            \ manipulation methods inherited by\n a whole category of Shape objects.\n\
            \ The manipulation methods provided by this class can be used to\n query\
            \ and modify the rectangular frame, which provides a reference\n for the\
            \ subclasses to define their geometry."
