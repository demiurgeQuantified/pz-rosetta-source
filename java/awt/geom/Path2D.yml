          notes: "The Path2D class provides a simple, yet flexible\n shape which represents\
            \ an arbitrary geometric path.\n It can fully represent any path which\
            \ can be iterated by the\n PathIterator interface including all of its\
            \ segment\n types and winding rules and it implements all of the\n basic\
            \ hit testing methods of the Shape interface.\n \n Use Path2D.Float when\
            \ dealing with data that can be represented\n and used with floating point\
            \ precision.  Use Path2D.Double\n for data that requires the accuracy\
            \ or range of double precision.\n \n Path2D provides exactly those facilities\
            \ required for\n basic construction and management of a geometric path\
            \ and\n implementation of the above interfaces with little added\n interpretation.\n\
            \ If it is useful to manipulate the interiors of closed\n geometric shapes\
            \ beyond simple hit testing then the\n Area class provides additional\
            \ capabilities\n specifically targeted at closed figures.\n While both\
            \ classes nominally implement the Shape\n interface, they differ in purpose\
            \ and together they provide\n two useful views of a geometric shape where\
            \ Path2D\n deals primarily with a trajectory formed by path segments\n\
            \ and Area deals more with interpretation and manipulation\n of enclosed\
            \ regions of 2D geometric space.\n \n The PathIterator interface has more\
            \ detailed descriptions\n of the types of segments that make up a path\
            \ and the winding rules\n that control how to determine which regions\
            \ are inside or outside\n the path."
