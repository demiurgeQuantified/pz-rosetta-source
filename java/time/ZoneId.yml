          notes: "A time-zone ID, such as Europe/Paris.\n \n A ZoneId is used to identify\
            \ the rules used to convert between\n an Instant and a LocalDateTime.\n\
            \ There are two distinct types of ID:\n \n Fixed offsets - a fully resolved\
            \ offset from UTC/Greenwich, that uses\n  the same offset for all local\
            \ date-times\n Geographical regions - an area where a specific set of\
            \ rules for finding\n  the offset from UTC/Greenwich apply\n \n Most fixed\
            \ offsets are represented by ZoneOffset.\n Calling normalized() on any\
            \ ZoneId will ensure that a\n fixed offset ID will be represented as a\
            \ ZoneOffset.\n \n The actual rules, describing when and how the offset\
            \ changes, are defined by ZoneRules.\n This class is simply an ID used\
            \ to obtain the underlying rules.\n This approach is taken because rules\
            \ are defined by governments and change\n frequently, whereas the ID is\
            \ stable.\n \n The distinction has other effects. Serializing the ZoneId\
            \ will only send\n the ID, whereas serializing the rules sends the entire\
            \ data set.\n Similarly, a comparison of two IDs only examines the ID,\
            \ whereas\n a comparison of two rules examines the entire data set.\n\n\
            \ Time-zone IDs\n The ID is unique within the system.\n There are three\
            \ types of ID.\n \n The simplest type of ID is that from ZoneOffset.\n\
            \ This consists of 'Z' and IDs starting with '+' or '-'.\n \n The next\
            \ type of ID are offset-style IDs with some form of prefix,\n such as\
            \ 'GMT+2' or 'UTC+01:00'.\n The recognised prefixes are 'UTC', 'GMT' and\
            \ 'UT'.\n The offset is the suffix and will be normalized during creation.\n\
            \ These IDs can be normalized to a ZoneOffset using normalized().\n \n\
            \ The third type of ID are region-based IDs. A region-based ID must be\
            \ of\n two or more characters, and not start with 'UTC', 'GMT', 'UT' '+'\
            \ or '-'.\n Region-based IDs are defined by configuration, see ZoneRulesProvider.\n\
            \ The configuration focuses on providing the lookup from the ID to the\n\
            \ underlying ZoneRules.\n \n Time-zone rules are defined by governments\
            \ and change frequently.\n There are a number of organizations, known\
            \ here as groups, that monitor\n time-zone changes and collate them.\n\
            \ The default group is the IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB).\n Other organizations\
            \ include IATA (the airline industry body) and Microsoft.\n \n Each group\
            \ defines its own format for the region ID it provides.\n The TZDB group\
            \ defines IDs such as 'Europe/London' or 'America/New_York'.\n TZDB IDs\
            \ take precedence over other groups.\n \n It is strongly recommended that\
            \ the group name is included in all IDs supplied by\n groups other than\
            \ TZDB to avoid conflicts. For example, IATA airline time-zone\n region\
            \ IDs are typically the same as the three letter airport code.\n However,\
            \ the airport of Utrecht has the code 'UTC', which is obviously a conflict.\n\
            \ The recommended format for region IDs from groups other than TZDB is\
            \ 'group~region'.\n Thus if IATA data were defined, Utrecht airport would\
            \ be 'IATA~UTC'.\n\n Serialization\n This class can be serialized and\
            \ stores the string zone ID in the external form.\n The ZoneOffset subclass\
            \ uses a dedicated format that only stores the\n offset from UTC/Greenwich.\n\
            \ \n A ZoneId can be deserialized in a Java Runtime where the ID is unknown.\n\
            \ For example, if a server-side Java Runtime has been updated with a new\
            \ zone ID, but\n the client-side Java Runtime has not been updated. In\
            \ this case, the ZoneId\n object will exist, and can be queried using\
            \ getId, equals,\n hashCode, toString, getDisplayName and normalized.\n\
            \ However, any call to getRules will fail with ZoneRulesException.\n This\
            \ approach is designed to allow a ZonedDateTime to be loaded and\n queried,\
            \ but not modified, on a Java Runtime with incomplete time-zone information.\n\
            \ \n This is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat instances\
            \ that are\n equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances for\
            \ synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example,\
            \ in a future release, synchronization may fail.\n The equals method should\
            \ be used for comparisons."

              \ ID starts with '+' or '-', the ID is parsed as a\n  ZoneOffset using\
              \ ZoneOffset.of(String).\n If the zone ID equals 'GMT', 'UTC' or 'UT'\
              \ then the result is a ZoneId\n  with the same ID and rules equivalent\
              \ to ZoneOffset.UTC.\n If the zone ID starts with 'UTC+', 'UTC-', 'GMT+',\
              \ 'GMT-', 'UT+' or 'UT-'\n  then the ID is a prefixed offset-based ID.\
              \ The ID is split in two, with\n  a two or three letter prefix and a\
              \ suffix starting with the sign.\n  The suffix is parsed as a ZoneOffset.\n\
              \  The result will be a ZoneId with the specified UTC/GMT/UT prefix\n\
              \  and the normalized offset ID as per ZoneOffset.getId().\n  The rules\
              \ of the returned ZoneId will be equivalent to the\n  parsed ZoneOffset.\n\
              \ All other IDs are parsed as region-based zone IDs. Region IDs must\n\
              \  match the regular expression [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9~/._+-]+\n  otherwise\
              \ a DateTimeException is thrown. If the zone ID is not\n  in the configured\
              \ set of IDs, ZoneRulesException is thrown.\n  The detailed format of\
              \ the region ID depends on the group supplying the data.\n  The default\
              \ set of data is supplied by the IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB).\n \
              \ This has region IDs of the form '{area}/{city}', such as 'Europe/Paris'\
              \ or 'America/New_York'.\n  This is compatible with most IDs from TimeZone."
