          notes: "An instantaneous point on the time-line.\n \n This class models\
            \ a single instantaneous point on the time-line.\n This might be used\
            \ to record event time-stamps in the application.\n \n The range of an\
            \ instant requires the storage of a number larger than a long.\n To achieve\
            \ this, the class stores a long representing epoch-seconds and an\n int\
            \ representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and\
            \ 999,999,999.\n The epoch-seconds are measured from the standard Java\
            \ epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\n where instants after the epoch have\
            \ positive values, and earlier instants have negative values.\n For both\
            \ the epoch-second and nanosecond parts, a larger value is always later\
            \ on the time-line\n than a smaller value.\n\n Time-scale\n \n The length\
            \ of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.\n This\
            \ has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60\
            \ seconds,\n forming a 86400 second day.\n \n Modern timekeeping is based\
            \ on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second\n relative to the\
            \ transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined\n\
            \ to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.\n \n Unfortunately,\
            \ as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.\n In addition, over\
            \ time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.\n\
            \ As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than\
            \ 86400 SI seconds.\n The actual length of any given day and the amount\
            \ by which the Earth is slowing\n are not predictable and can only be\
            \ determined by measurement.\n The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate\
            \ length of day, but is only available some\n time after the day has completed.\n\
            \ \n The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional\
            \ fractions\n of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as leap-seconds.\n\
            \ A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational\
            \ changes.\n As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401\
            \ SI seconds where\n necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the\
            \ Sun.\n \n The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing\
            \ the concept of whole leap-seconds.\n Between 1958 and 1972, the definition\
            \ of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and\n alterations to\
            \ the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway\n\
            \ to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove\
            \ leap seconds or\n introduce other changes.\n \n Given the complexity\
            \ of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines\n its\
            \ own time-scale, the Java Time-Scale.\n \n The Java Time-Scale divides\
            \ each calendar day into exactly 86400\n subdivisions, known as seconds.\
            \  These seconds may differ from the\n SI second.  It closely matches\
            \ the de facto international civil time\n scale, the definition of which\
            \ changes from time to time.\n \n The Java Time-Scale has slightly different\
            \ definitions for different\n segments of the time-line, each based on\
            \ the consensus international\n time scale that is used as the basis for\
            \ civil time. Whenever the\n internationally-agreed time scale is modified\
            \ or replaced, a new\n segment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined\
            \ for it.  Each segment\n must meet these requirements:\n \n the Java\
            \ Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international\n  civil\
            \ time scale;\n the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international\
            \ civil\n  time scale at noon each day;\n the Java Time-Scale shall have\
            \ a precisely-defined relationship to\n  the international civil time\
            \ scale.\n \n There are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java\
            \ time-scale.\n \n For the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed\
            \ below) until\n further notice, the consensus international time scale\
            \ is UTC (with\n leap seconds).  In this segment, the Java Time-Scale\
            \ is identical to\n UTC-SLS.\n This is identical to UTC on days that do\
            \ not have a leap second.\n On days that do have a leap second, the leap\
            \ second is spread equally\n over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining\
            \ the appearance of\n exactly 86400 seconds per day.\n \n For the segment\
            \ prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,\n the consensus\
            \ international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied\n proleptically,\
            \ which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the\n prime meridian\
            \ (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is\n identical to\
            \ the consensus international time scale. The exact\n boundary between\
            \ the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC\n between 1972-11-03T00:00\
            \ and 1972-11-04T12:00.\n \n Implementations of the Java time-scale using\
            \ the JSR-310 API are not\n required to provide any clock that is sub-second\
            \ accurate, or that\n progresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations\
            \ are therefore\n not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or\
            \ to otherwise be\n aware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require\
            \ that\n implementations must document the approach they use when defining\
            \ a\n clock representing the current instant.\n See Clock for details\
            \ on the available clocks.\n \n The Java time-scale is used for all date-time\
            \ classes.\n This includes Instant, LocalDate, LocalTime, OffsetDateTime,\n\
            \ ZonedDateTime and Duration.\n \n This is a value-based\n class; programmers\
            \ should treat instances that are\n equal as interchangeable and should\
            \ not\n use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may\n\
            \ occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.\n\
            \ The equals method should be used for comparisons."
