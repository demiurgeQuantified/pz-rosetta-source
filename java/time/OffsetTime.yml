          notes: "A time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar\
            \ system,\n such as 10:15:30+01:00.\n \n OffsetTime is an immutable date-time\
            \ object that represents a time, often\n viewed as hour-minute-second-offset.\n\
            \ This class stores all time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,\n\
            \ as well as a zone offset.\n For example, the value \"13:45:30.123456789+02:00\"\
            \ can be stored\n in an OffsetTime.\n \n This is a value-based\n class;\
            \ programmers should treat instances that are\n equal as interchangeable\
            \ and should not\n use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable\
            \ behavior may\n occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization\
            \ may fail.\n The equals method should be used for comparisons."
