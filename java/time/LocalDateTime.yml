          notes: "A date-time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,\n\
            \ such as 2007-12-03T10:15:30.\n \n LocalDateTime is an immutable date-time\
            \ object that represents a date-time,\n often viewed as year-month-day-hour-minute-second.\
            \ Other date and time fields,\n such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year,\
            \ can also be accessed.\n Time is represented to nanosecond precision.\n\
            \ For example, the value \"2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789\" can\
            \ be\n stored in a LocalDateTime.\n \n This class does not store or represent\
            \ a time-zone.\n Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for\
            \ birthdays, combined with\n the local time as seen on a wall clock.\n\
            \ It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information\n\
            \ such as an offset or time-zone.\n \n The ISO-8601 calendar system is\
            \ the modern civil calendar system used today\n in most of the world.\
            \ It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n system, in which\
            \ today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.\n For most applications\
            \ written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.\n However,\
            \ any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them\n\
            \ to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.\n \n This\
            \ is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat instances that are\n\
            \ equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances for synchronization,\
            \ or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example, in a future release,\
            \ synchronization may fail.\n The equals method should be used for comparisons."
