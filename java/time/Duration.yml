          notes: "A time-based amount of time, such as '34.5 seconds'.\n \n This class\
            \ models a quantity or amount of time in terms of seconds and nanoseconds.\n\
            \ It can be accessed using other duration-based units, such as minutes\
            \ and hours.\n In addition, the DAYS unit can be used and is treated as\n\
            \ exactly equal to 24 hours, thus ignoring daylight savings effects.\n\
            \ See Period for the date-based equivalent to this class.\n \n A physical\
            \ duration could be of infinite length.\n For practicality, the duration\
            \ is stored with constraints similar to Instant.\n The duration uses nanosecond\
            \ resolution with a maximum value of the seconds that can\n be held in\
            \ a long. This is greater than the current estimated age of the universe.\n\
            \ \n The range of a duration requires the storage of a number larger than\
            \ a long.\n To achieve this, the class stores a long representing seconds\
            \ and an int\n representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be\
            \ between 0 and 999,999,999.\n The model is of a directed duration, meaning\
            \ that the duration may be negative.\n \n The duration is measured in\
            \ \"seconds\", but these are not necessarily identical to\n the scientific\
            \ \"SI second\" definition based on atomic clocks.\n This difference only\
            \ impacts durations measured near a leap-second and should not affect\n\
            \ most applications.\n See Instant for a discussion as to the meaning\
            \ of the second and time-scales.\n \n This is a value-based\n class; programmers\
            \ should treat instances that are\n equal as interchangeable and should\
            \ not\n use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may\n\
            \ occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.\n\
            \ The equals method should be used for comparisons."
