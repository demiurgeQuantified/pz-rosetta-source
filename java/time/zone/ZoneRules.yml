            \ \n The rules model all the historic and future transitions for a time-zone.\n\
            \ ZoneOffsetTransition is used for known transitions, typically historic.\n\
            \ ZoneOffsetTransitionRule is used for future transitions that are based\n\
            \ on the result of an algorithm.\n \n The rules are loaded via ZoneRulesProvider\
            \ using a ZoneId.\n The same rules may be shared internally between multiple\
            \ zone IDs.\n \n Serializing an instance of ZoneRules will store the entire\
            \ set of rules.\n It does not store the zone ID as it is not part of the\
            \ state of this object.\n \n A rule implementation may or may not store\
            \ full information about historic\n and future transitions, and the information\
