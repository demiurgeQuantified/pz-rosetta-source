          notes: "A date-time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar\
            \ system,\n such as 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00.\n \n OffsetDateTime is\
            \ an immutable representation of a date-time with an offset.\n This class\
            \ stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,\n as\
            \ well as the offset from UTC/Greenwich. For example, the value\n \"2nd\
            \ October 2007 at 13:45:30.123456789 +02:00\" can be stored in an OffsetDateTime.\n\
            \ \n OffsetDateTime, ZonedDateTime and Instant all store an instant\n\
            \ on the time-line to nanosecond precision.\n Instant is the simplest,\
            \ simply representing the instant.\n OffsetDateTime adds to the instant\
            \ the offset from UTC/Greenwich, which allows\n the local date-time to\
            \ be obtained.\n ZonedDateTime adds full time-zone rules.\n \n It is intended\
            \ that ZonedDateTime or Instant is used to model data\n in simpler applications.\
            \ This class may be used when modeling date-time concepts in\n more detail,\
            \ or when communicating to a database or in a network protocol.\n \n This\
            \ is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat instances that are\n\
            \ equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances for synchronization,\
            \ or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example, in a future release,\
            \ synchronization may fail.\n The equals method should be used for comparisons."
