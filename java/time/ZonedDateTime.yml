              \ start and end points are this and the specified date-time.\n The result\
              \ will be negative if the end is before the start.\n For example, the\
              \ amount in days between two date-times can be calculated\n using startDateTime.until(endDateTime,\
              \ DAYS).\n \n The Temporal passed to this method is converted to a\n\
              \ ZonedDateTime using from(TemporalAccessor).\n If the time-zone differs\
              \ between the two zoned date-times, the specified\n end date-time is\
              \ normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.\n \n The calculation\
              \ returns a whole number, representing the number of\n complete units\
              \ between the two date-times.\n For example, the amount in months between\
              \ 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z\n will only be one month as\
              \ it is one minute short of two months.\n \n There are two equivalent\
              \ ways of using this method.\n The first is to invoke this method.\n\
              \ The second is to use TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal):\n \n\

              \ should be made based on which makes the code more readable.\n \n The\
              \ calculation is implemented in this method for ChronoUnit.\n The units\
              \ NANOS, MICROS, MILLIS, SECONDS,\n MINUTES, HOURS and HALF_DAYS, DAYS,\n\
              \ WEEKS, MONTHS, YEARS, DECADES,\n CENTURIES, MILLENNIA and ERAS are\
              \ supported.\n Other ChronoUnit values will throw an exception.\n \n\
              \ The calculation for date and time units differ.\n \n Date units operate\
              \ on the local time-line, using the local date-time.\n For example,\
              \ the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day\n in days\
              \ will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether\n\
              \ there was a daylight savings change or not.\n \n Time units operate\
              \ on the instant time-line.\n The calculation effectively converts both\
              \ zoned date-times to instants\n and then calculates the period between\
              \ the instants.\n For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon\
              \ the following day\n in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other\
              \ amount) depending on\n whether there was a daylight savings change\
              \ or not.\n \n If the unit is not a ChronoUnit, then the result of this\
              \ method\n is obtained by invoking TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)\n\
              \ passing this as the first argument and the converted input temporal\n\
