          notes: "The Dictionary class is the abstract parent of any\n class, such\
            \ as Hashtable, which maps keys to values.\n Every key and every value\
            \ is an object. In any one Dictionary\n object, every key is associated\
            \ with at most one value. Given a\n Dictionary and a key, the associated\
            \ element can be looked up.\n Any non-null object can be used as a key\
            \ and as a value.\n \n As a rule, the equals method should be used by\n\
            \ implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.\n\
            \ \n NOTE: This class is obsolete.  New implementations should\n implement\
            \ the Map interface, rather than extending this class."
