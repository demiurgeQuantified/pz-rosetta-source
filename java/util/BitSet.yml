          notes: "This class implements a vector of bits that grows as needed. Each\n\
            \ component of the bit set has a boolean value. The\n bits of a BitSet\
            \ are indexed by nonnegative integers.\n Individual indexed bits can be\
            \ examined, set, or cleared. One\n BitSet may be used to modify the contents\
            \ of another\n BitSet through logical AND, logical inclusive OR, and\n\
            \ logical exclusive OR operations.\n\n By default, all bits in the set\
            \ initially have the value\n false.\n\n Every bit set has a current size,\
            \ which is the number of bits\n of space currently in use by the bit set.\
            \ Note that the size is\n related to the implementation of a bit set,\
            \ so it may change with\n implementation. The length of a bit set relates\
            \ to logical length\n of a bit set and is defined independently of implementation.\n\
            \n Unless otherwise noted, passing a null parameter to any of the\n methods\
            \ in a BitSet will result in a\n NullPointerException.\n\n A BitSet is\
            \ not safe for multithreaded use without\n external synchronization."
