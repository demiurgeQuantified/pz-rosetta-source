            \ that may entail a notion of ownership.  The\n AbstractOwnableSynchronizer\
            \ class itself does not manage or\n use this information. However, subclasses\
            \ and tools may use\n appropriately maintained values to help control\
            \ and monitor access\n and provide diagnostics."
