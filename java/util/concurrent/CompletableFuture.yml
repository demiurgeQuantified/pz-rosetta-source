          notes: "A Future that may be explicitly completed (setting its\n value and\
            \ status), and may be used as a CompletionStage,\n supporting dependent\
            \ functions and actions that trigger upon its\n completion.\n\n When two\
            \ or more threads attempt to\n complete,\n completeExceptionally, or\n\
            \ cancel\n a CompletableFuture, only one of them succeeds.\n\n In addition\
            \ to these and related methods for directly\n manipulating status and\
            \ results, CompletableFuture implements\n interface CompletionStage with\
            \ the following policies: \n\n Actions supplied for dependent completions\
            \ of\n non-async methods may be performed by the thread that\n completes\
            \ the current CompletableFuture, or by any other caller of\n a completion\
            \ method.\n\n All async methods without an explicit Executor\n argument\
            \ are performed using the ForkJoinPool.commonPool()\n (unless it does\
            \ not support a parallelism level of at least two, in\n which case, a\
            \ new Thread is created to run each task).  This may be\n overridden for\
            \ non-static methods in subclasses by defining method\n defaultExecutor().\
            \ To simplify monitoring, debugging,\n and tracking, all generated asynchronous\
            \ tasks are instances of the\n marker interface CompletableFuture.AsynchronousCompletionTask.\
            \  Operations\n with time-delays can use adapter methods defined in this\
            \ class, for\n example: supplyAsync(supplier, delayedExecutor(timeout,\n\
            \ timeUnit)).  To support methods with delays and timeouts, this\n class\
            \ maintains at most one daemon thread for triggering and\n cancelling\
            \ actions, not for running them.\n\n All CompletionStage methods are implemented\
            \ independently of\n other public methods, so the behavior of one method\
            \ is not impacted\n by overrides of others in subclasses.\n\n All CompletionStage\
            \ methods return CompletableFutures.  To\n restrict usages to only those\
            \ methods defined in interface\n CompletionStage, use method minimalCompletionStage().\
            \ Or to\n ensure only that clients do not themselves modify a future,\
            \ use\n method copy().\n \n\n CompletableFuture also implements Future\
            \ with the following\n policies: \n\n Since (unlike FutureTask) this class\
            \ has no direct\n control over the computation that causes it to be completed,\n\
            \ cancellation is treated as just another form of exceptional\n completion.\
            \  Method cancel has the same effect as\n completeExceptionally(new CancellationException()).\
            \ Method\n isCompletedExceptionally() can be used to determine if a\n\
            \ CompletableFuture completed in any exceptional fashion.\n\n In case\
            \ of exceptional completion with a CompletionException,\n methods get()\
            \ and get(long, TimeUnit) throw an\n ExecutionException with the same\
            \ cause as held in the\n corresponding CompletionException.  To simplify\
            \ usage in most\n contexts, this class also defines methods join() and\n\
            \ getNow(T) that instead throw the CompletionException directly\n in these\
            \ cases.\n \n\n Arguments used to pass a completion result (that is, for\n\
            \ parameters of type T) for methods accepting them may be\n null, but\
            \ passing a null value for any other parameter will result\n in a NullPointerException\
            \ being thrown.\n\n Subclasses of this class should normally override\
            \ the \"virtual\n constructor\" method newIncompleteFuture(), which establishes\n\
            \ the concrete type returned by CompletionStage methods. For example,\n\
            \ here is a class that substitutes a different default Executor and\n\
            \ disables the obtrude methods:\n\n  <code>\n class MyCompletableFuture<T>\
            \ extends CompletableFuture<T> {\n   static final Executor myExecutor\
            \ = ...;\n   public MyCompletableFuture() { }\n   public <U> CompletableFuture<U>\
            \ newIncompleteFuture() {\n     return new MyCompletableFuture<U>(); }\n\
            \   public Executor defaultExecutor() {\n     return myExecutor; }\n \
            \  public void obtrudeValue(T value) {\n     throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\
            \ }\n   public void obtrudeException(Throwable ex) {\n     throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\
            \ }\n }</code>"
