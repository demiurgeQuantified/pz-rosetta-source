          notes: "An unbounded thread-safe queue based on linked nodes.\n This queue\
            \ orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).\n The head of the queue is\
            \ that element that has been on the\n queue the longest time.\n The tail\
            \ of the queue is that element that has been on the\n queue the shortest\
            \ time. New elements\n are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the\
            \ queue retrieval\n operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.\n\
            \ A ConcurrentLinkedQueue is an appropriate choice when\n many threads\
            \ will share access to a common collection.\n Like most other concurrent\
            \ collection implementations, this class\n does not permit the use of\
            \ null elements.\n\n This implementation employs an efficient non-blocking\n\
            \ algorithm based on one described in\n \n Simple, Fast, and Practical\
            \ Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue\n Algorithms by Maged M.\
            \ Michael and Michael L. Scott.\n\n Iterators are weakly consistent, returning\
            \ elements\n reflecting the state of the queue at some point at or since\
            \ the\n creation of the iterator.  They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException,\
            \ and may proceed concurrently\n with other operations.  Elements contained\
            \ in the queue since the creation\n of the iterator will be returned exactly\
            \ once.\n\n Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method\n\
            \ is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the\n asynchronous nature\
            \ of these queues, determining the current number\n of elements requires\
            \ a traversal of the elements, and so may report\n inaccurate results\
            \ if this collection is modified during traversal.\n\n Bulk operations\
            \ that add, remove, or examine multiple elements,\n such as addAll(java.util.Collection<?\
            \ extends E>), removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate<? super E>) or forEach(java.util.function.Consumer<?\
            \ super E>),\n are not guaranteed to be performed atomically.\n For example,\
            \ a forEach traversal concurrent with an \n addAll operation might observe\
            \ only some of the added elements.\n\n This class and its iterator implement\
            \ all of the optional\n methods of the Queue and Iterator interfaces.\n\
            \n Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent\n collections,\
            \ actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a\n ConcurrentLinkedQueue\n\
            \ happen-before\n actions subsequent to the access or removal of that\
            \ element from\n the ConcurrentLinkedQueue in another thread.\n\n This\
            \ class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
