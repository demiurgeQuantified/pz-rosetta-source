          notes: "An optionally-bounded blocking queue based on\n linked nodes.\n\
            \ This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).\n The head of\
            \ the queue is that element that has been on the\n queue the longest time.\n\
            \ The tail of the queue is that element that has been on the\n queue the\
            \ shortest time. New elements\n are inserted at the tail of the queue,\
            \ and the queue retrieval\n operations obtain elements at the head of\
            \ the queue.\n Linked queues typically have higher throughput than array-based\
            \ queues but\n less predictable performance in most concurrent applications.\n\
            \n The optional capacity bound constructor argument serves as a\n way\
            \ to prevent excessive queue expansion. The capacity, if unspecified,\n\
            \ is equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE.  Linked nodes are\n dynamically created\
            \ upon each insertion unless this would bring the\n queue above capacity.\n\
            \n This class and its iterator implement all of the optional\n methods\
            \ of the Collection and Iterator interfaces.\n\n This class is a member\
            \ of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
