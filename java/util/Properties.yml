          notes: "The Properties class represents a persistent set of\n properties.\
            \ The Properties can be saved to a stream\n or loaded from a stream. Each\
            \ key and its corresponding value in\n the property list is a string.\n\
            \ \n A property list can contain another property list as its\n \"defaults\"\
            ; this second property list is searched if\n the property key is not found\
            \ in the original property list.\n \n Because Properties inherits from\
            \ Hashtable, the\n put and putAll methods can be applied to a\n Properties\
            \ object.  Their use is strongly discouraged as they\n allow the caller\
            \ to insert entries whose keys or values are not\n Strings.  The setProperty\
            \ method should be used\n instead.  If the store or save method is called\n\
            \ on a \"compromised\" Properties object that contains a\n non-String\
            \ key or value, the call will fail. Similarly,\n the call to the propertyNames\
            \ or list method\n will fail if it is called on a \"compromised\" Properties\n\
            \ object that contains a non-String key.\n\n \n The iterators returned\
            \ by the iterator method of this class's\n \"collection views\" (that\
            \ is, entrySet(), keySet(), and\n values()) may not fail-fast (unlike\
            \ the Hashtable implementation).\n These iterators are guaranteed to traverse\
            \ elements as they existed upon\n construction exactly once, and may (but\
            \ are not guaranteed to) reflect any\n modifications subsequent to construction.\n\
            \ \n The load(Reader) /\n store(Writer, String)\n methods load and store\
            \ properties from and to a character based stream\n in a simple line-oriented\
            \ format specified below.\n\n The load(InputStream) /\n store(OutputStream,\
            \ String)\n methods work the same way as the load(Reader)/store(Writer,\
            \ String) pair, except\n the input/output stream is encoded in ISO 8859-1\
            \ character encoding.\n Characters that cannot be directly represented\
            \ in this encoding can be written using\n Unicode escapes as defined in\
            \ section 3.3 of\n The Java Language Specification;\n only a single 'u'\
            \ character is allowed in an escape\n sequence.\n\n  The loadFromXML(InputStream)\
            \ and storeToXML(OutputStream, String, String) methods load and store\
            \ properties\n in a simple XML format.  By default the UTF-8 character\
            \ encoding is used,\n however a specific encoding may be specified if\
            \ required. Implementations\n are required to support UTF-8 and UTF-16\
            \ and may support other encodings.\n An XML properties document has the\
            \ following DOCTYPE declaration:\n\n \n <!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM \"\
            http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd\">\n \n Note that the system URI\
            \ (http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd) is\n not accessed when exporting\
            \ or importing properties; it merely\n serves as a string to uniquely\
            \ identify the DTD, which is:\n \n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"\
            UTF-8\"?>\n\n    <!-- DTD for properties -->\n\n    <!ELEMENT properties\
            \ ( comment?, entry* ) >\n\n    <!ATTLIST properties version CDATA #FIXED\
            \ \"1.0\">\n\n    <!ELEMENT comment (#PCDATA) >\n\n    <!ELEMENT entry\
            \ (#PCDATA) >\n\n    <!ATTLIST entry key CDATA #REQUIRED>\n \n\n This\
            \ class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single\n Properties\
            \ object without the need for external synchronization."

            notes: "Reads a property list (key and element pairs) from the input\n\
              \ character stream in a simple line-oriented format.\n \n Properties\
              \ are processed in terms of lines. There are two\n kinds of line, natural\
              \ lines and logical lines.\n A natural line is defined as a line of\n\
              \ characters that is terminated either by a set of line terminator\n\
              \ characters (\\n or \\r or \\r\\n)\n or by the end of the stream. A\
              \ natural line may be either a blank line,\n a comment line, or hold\
              \ all or some of a key-element pair. A logical\n line holds all the\
              \ data of a key-element pair, which may be spread\n out across several\
              \ adjacent natural lines by escaping\n the line terminator sequence\
              \ with a backslash character\n \\.  Note that a comment line cannot\
              \ be extended\n in this manner; every natural line that is a comment\
              \ must have\n its own comment indicator, as described below. Lines are\
              \ read from\n input until the end of the stream is reached.\n\n \n A\
              \ natural line that contains only white space characters is\n considered\
              \ blank and is ignored.  A comment line has an ASCII\n '#' or '!' as\
              \ its first non-white\n space character; comment lines are also ignored\
              \ and do not\n encode key-element information.  In addition to line\n\
              \ terminators, this format considers the characters space\n (' ', '\\\
              u0020'), tab\n ('\\t', '\\u0009'), and form feed\n ('\\f', '\\u000C')\
              \ to be white\n space.\n\n \n If a logical line is spread across several\
              \ natural lines, the\n backslash escaping the line terminator sequence,\
              \ the line\n terminator sequence, and any white space at the start of\
              \ the\n following line have no affect on the key or element values.\n\
              \ The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing\n (when\
              \ loading) will assume all the characters constituting\n the key and\
              \ element appear on a single natural line after\n line continuation\
              \ characters have been removed.  Note that\n it is not sufficient to\
              \ only examine the character\n preceding a line terminator sequence\
              \ to decide if the line\n terminator is escaped; there must be an odd\
              \ number of\n contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped.\n\
              \ Since the input is processed from left to right, a\n non-zero even\
              \ number of 2n contiguous backslashes\n before a line terminator (or\
              \ elsewhere) encodes n\n backslashes after escape processing.\n\n \n\
              \ The key contains all of the characters in the line starting\n with\
              \ the first non-white space character and up to, but not\n including,\
              \ the first unescaped '=',\n ':', or white space character other than\
              \ a line\n terminator. All of these key termination characters may be\n\
              \ included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash\n\
              \ character; for example,\n\n \\:\\=\n\n would be the two-character\
              \ key \":=\".  Line\n terminator characters can be included using \\\
              r and\n \\n escape sequences.  Any white space after the\n key is skipped;\
              \ if the first non-white space character after\n the key is '=' or ':',\
              \ then it is\n ignored and any white space characters after it are also\n\
              \ skipped.  All remaining characters on the line become part of\n the\
              \ associated element string; if there are no remaining\n characters,\
              \ the element is the empty string\n \"\".  Once the raw character sequences\n\
              \ constituting the key and element are identified, escape\n processing\
              \ is performed as described above.\n\n \n As an example, each of the\
              \ following three lines specifies the key\n \"Truth\" and the associated\
              \ element value\n \"Beauty\":\n \n Truth = Beauty\n  Truth:Beauty\n\
              \ Truth                    :Beauty\n \n As another example, the following\
              \ three lines specify a single\n property:\n \n fruits             \
              \              apple, banana, pear, \\\n                           \
              \       cantaloupe, watermelon, \\\n                               \
              \   kiwi, mango\n \n The key is \"fruits\" and the associated element\
              \ is:\n \"apple, banana, pear, cantaloupe, watermelon, kiwi, mango\"\
              \n Note that a space appears before each \\ so that a space\n will appear\
              \ after each comma in the final result; the \\,\n line terminator, and\
              \ leading white space on the continuation line are\n merely discarded\
              \ and are not replaced by one or more other\n characters.\n \n As a\
              \ third example, the line:\n cheeses\n \n specifies that the key is\
              \ \"cheeses\" and the associated\n element is the empty string \"\"\
              .\n \n \n Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape\n\
              \ sequences similar to those used for character and string literals\n\
              \ (see sections 3.3 and 3.10.6 of\n The Java Language Specification).\n\
              \n The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode\n\
              \ escapes used for characters and strings are:\n\n \n  Octal escapes\
              \ are not recognized.\n\n  The character sequence \\b does not\n represent\
              \ a backspace character.\n\n  The method does not treat a backslash\
              \ character,\n \\, before a non-valid escape character as an\n error;\
              \ the backslash is silently dropped.  For example, in a\n Java string\
              \ the sequence \"\\z\" would cause a\n compile time error.  In contrast,\
              \ this method silently drops\n the backslash.  Therefore, this method\
              \ treats the two character\n sequence \"\\b\" as equivalent to the single\n\
              \ character 'b'.\n\n  Escapes are not necessary for single and double\
              \ quotes;\n however, by the rule above, single and double quote characters\n\
              \ preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote\n characters,\
              \ respectively.\n\n  Only a single 'u' character is allowed in a Unicode\
              \ escape\n sequence.\n\n \n \n The specified stream remains open after\
              \ this method returns."
