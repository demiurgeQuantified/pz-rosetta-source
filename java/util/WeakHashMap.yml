          notes: "Hash table based implementation of the Map interface, with\n weak\
            \ keys.\n An entry in a WeakHashMap will automatically be removed when\n\
            \ its key is no longer in ordinary use.  More precisely, the presence\
            \ of a\n mapping for a given key will not prevent the key from being discarded\
            \ by the\n garbage collector, that is, made finalizable, finalized, and\
            \ then reclaimed.\n When a key has been discarded its entry is effectively\
            \ removed from the map,\n so this class behaves somewhat differently from\
            \ other Map\n implementations.\n\n  Both null values and the null key\
            \ are supported. This class has\n performance characteristics similar\
            \ to those of the HashMap\n class, and has the same efficiency parameters\
            \ of initial capacity\n and load factor.\n\n  Like most collection classes,\
            \ this class is not synchronized.\n A synchronized WeakHashMap may be\
            \ constructed using the\n Collections.synchronizedMap\n method.\n\n  This\
            \ class is intended primarily for use with key objects whose\n equals\
            \ methods test for object identity using the\n == operator.  Once such\
            \ a key is discarded it can never be\n recreated, so it is impossible\
            \ to do a lookup of that key in a\n WeakHashMap at some later time and\
            \ be surprised that its entry\n has been removed.  This class will work\
            \ perfectly well with key objects\n whose equals methods are not based\
            \ upon object identity, such\n as String instances.  With such recreatable\
            \ key objects,\n however, the automatic removal of WeakHashMap entries\
            \ whose\n keys have been discarded may prove to be confusing.\n\n  The\
            \ behavior of the WeakHashMap class depends in part upon\n the actions\
            \ of the garbage collector, so several familiar (though not\n required)\
            \ Map invariants do not hold for this class.  Because\n the garbage collector\
            \ may discard keys at any time, a\n WeakHashMap may behave as though an\
            \ unknown thread is silently\n removing entries.  In particular, even\
            \ if you synchronize on a\n WeakHashMap instance and invoke none of its\
            \ mutator methods, it\n is possible for the size method to return smaller\
            \ values over\n time, for the isEmpty method to return false and\n then\
            \ true, for the containsKey method to return\n true and later false for\
            \ a given key, for the\n get method to return a value for a given key\
            \ but later return\n null, for the put method to return\n null and the\
            \ remove method to return\n false for a key that previously appeared to\
            \ be in the map, and\n for successive examinations of the key set, the\
            \ value collection, and\n the entry set to yield successively smaller\
            \ numbers of elements.\n\n  Each key object in a WeakHashMap is stored\
            \ indirectly as\n the referent of a weak reference.  Therefore a key will\
            \ automatically be\n removed only after the weak references to it, both\
            \ inside and outside of the\n map, have been cleared by the garbage collector.\n\
            \n  Implementation note: The value objects in a\n WeakHashMap are held\
            \ by ordinary strong references.  Thus care\n should be taken to ensure\
            \ that value objects do not strongly refer to their\n own keys, either\
            \ directly or indirectly, since that will prevent the keys\n from being\
            \ discarded.  Note that a value object may refer indirectly to its\n key\
            \ via the WeakHashMap itself; that is, a value object may\n strongly refer\
            \ to some other key object whose associated value object, in\n turn, strongly\
            \ refers to the key of the first value object.  If the values\n in the\
            \ map do not rely on the map holding strong references to them, one way\n\
            \ to deal with this is to wrap values themselves within\n WeakReferences\
            \ before\n inserting, as in: m.put(key, new WeakReference(value)),\n and\
            \ then unwrapping upon each get.\n\n The iterators returned by the iterator\
            \ method of the collections\n returned by all of this class's \"collection\
            \ view methods\" are\n fail-fast: if the map is structurally modified\
            \ at any time after the\n iterator is created, in any way except through\
            \ the iterator's own\n remove method, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\
            \  Thus, in the face of concurrent\n modification, the iterator fails\
            \ quickly and cleanly, rather than risking\n arbitrary, non-deterministic\
            \ behavior at an undetermined time in the future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking,\
            \ impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized\
            \ concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException\
            \ on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program\
            \ that depended on this\n exception for its correctness:  the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n This\
            \ class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
