          notes: "An unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap.\n The elements\
            \ of the priority queue are ordered according to their\n natural ordering,\
            \ or by a Comparator\n provided at queue construction time, depending\
            \ on which constructor is\n used.  A priority queue does not permit null\
            \ elements.\n A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not\
            \ permit\n insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in\n\
            \ ClassCastException).\n\n The head of this queue is the least element\n\
            \ with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple elements are\n\
            \ tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are\n\
            \ broken arbitrarily.  The queue retrieval operations poll,\n remove,\
            \ peek, and element access the\n element at the head of the queue.\n\n\
            \ A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal\n capacity governing\
            \ the size of an array used to store the\n elements on the queue.  It\
            \ is always at least as large as the queue\n size.  As elements are added\
            \ to a priority queue, its capacity\n grows automatically.  The details\
            \ of the growth policy are not\n specified.\n\n This class and its iterator\
            \ implement all of the\n optional methods of the Collection and Iterator\
            \ interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method iterator() and the Spliterator\
            \ provided in method spliterator()\n are not guaranteed to traverse the\
            \ elements of\n the priority queue in any particular order. If you need\
            \ ordered\n traversal, consider using Arrays.sort(pq.toArray()).\n\n Note\
            \ that this implementation is not synchronized.\n Multiple threads should\
            \ not access a PriorityQueue\n instance concurrently if any of the threads\
            \ modifies the queue.\n Instead, use the thread-safe PriorityBlockingQueue\
            \ class.\n\n Implementation note: this implementation provides\n O(log(n))\
            \ time for the enqueuing and dequeuing methods\n (offer, poll, remove()\
            \ and add);\n linear time for the remove(Object) and contains(Object)\n\
            \ methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods\n (peek, element,\
            \ and size).\n\n This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
