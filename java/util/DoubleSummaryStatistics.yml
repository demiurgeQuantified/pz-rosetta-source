              \ both of the\n input values as well as the order of addition operations.\
              \ The\n order of addition operations of this method is intentionally\n\
              \ not defined to allow for implementation flexibility to improve\n the\
              \ speed and accuracy of the computed result.\n\n In particular, this\
              \ method may be implemented using compensated\n summation or other technique\
              \ to reduce the error bound in the\n numerical sum compared to a simple\
              \ summation of double\n values.\n\n Because of the unspecified order\
              \ of operations and the\n possibility of using differing summation schemes,\
              \ the output of\n this method may vary on the same input values.\n\n\
              \ Various conditions can result in a non-finite sum being\n computed.\
              \ This can occur even if the all the recorded values\n being summed\
              \ are finite. If any recorded value is non-finite,\n the sum will be\
              \ non-finite:\n\n \n\n If any recorded value is a NaN, then the final\
              \ sum will be\n NaN.\n\n If the recorded values contain one or more\
              \ infinities, the\n sum will be infinite or NaN.\n\n \n\n If the recorded\
              \ values contain infinities of opposite sign,\n the sum will be NaN.\n\
              \n If the recorded values contain infinities of one sign and\n an intermediate\
              \ sum overflows to an infinity of the opposite\n sign, the sum may be\
              \ NaN.\n\n \n\n \n\n It is possible for intermediate sums of finite\
              \ values to\n overflow into opposite-signed infinities; if that occurs,\
              \ the\n final sum will be NaN even if the recorded values are all\n\
              \ finite.\n\n If all the recorded values are zero, the sign of zero\
              \ is\n not guaranteed to be preserved in the final sum."
