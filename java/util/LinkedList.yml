          notes: "Doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque\n interfaces.\
            \  Implements all optional list operations, and permits all\n elements\
            \ (including null).\n\n All of the operations perform as could be expected\
            \ for a doubly-linked\n list.  Operations that index into the list will\
            \ traverse the list from\n the beginning or the end, whichever is closer\
            \ to the specified index.\n\n Note that this implementation is not synchronized.\n\
            \ If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least\n\
            \ one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be\n synchronized\
            \ externally.  (A structural modification is any operation\n that adds\
            \ or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of\n an element\
            \ is not a structural modification.)  This is typically\n accomplished\
            \ by synchronizing on some object that naturally\n encapsulates the list.\n\
            \n If no such object exists, the list should be \"wrapped\" using the\n\
            \ Collections.synchronizedList\n method.  This is best done at creation\
            \ time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized access to the list:\n \
            \  List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));\n\n\
            \ The iterators returned by this class's iterator and\n listIterator methods\
            \ are fail-fast: if the list is\n structurally modified at any time after\
            \ the iterator is created, in\n any way except through the Iterator's\
            \ own remove or\n add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\
            \  Thus, in the face of concurrent\n modification, the iterator fails\
            \ quickly and cleanly, rather than\n risking arbitrary, non-deterministic\
            \ behavior at an undetermined\n time in the future.\n\n Note that the\
            \ fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally\
            \ speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of\
            \ unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw\
            \ ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore,\
            \ it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this\n exception\
            \ for its correctness:   the fail-fast behavior of iterators\n should\
            \ be used only to detect bugs.\n\n This class is a member of the\n \n\
            \ Java Collections Framework."

              \ the size of this list.\n\n If the list fits in the specified array\
              \ with room to spare (i.e.,\n the array has more elements than the list),\
              \ the element in the array\n immediately following the end of the list\
              \ is set to null.\n (This is useful in determining the length of the\
              \ list only if\n the caller knows that the list does not contain any\
              \ null elements.)\n\n Like the toArray() method, this method acts as\
              \ bridge between\n array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further,\
              \ this method allows\n precise control over the runtime type of the\
              \ output array, and may,\n under certain circumstances, be used to save\
              \ allocation costs.\n\n Suppose x is a list known to contain only strings.\n\
              \ The following code can be used to dump the list into a newly\n allocated\
              \ array of String:\n\n \n     String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);\n\
              \n Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to\n toArray()."
