          notes: "The Vector class implements a growable array of\n objects. Like\
            \ an array, it contains components that can be\n accessed using an integer\
            \ index. However, the size of a\n Vector can grow or shrink as needed\
            \ to accommodate\n adding and removing items after the Vector has been\
            \ created.\n\n Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining\
            \ a\n capacity and a capacityIncrement. The\n capacity is always at least\
            \ as large as the vector\n size; it is usually larger because as components\
            \ are added to the\n vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks\
            \ the size of\n capacityIncrement. An application can increase the\n capacity\
            \ of a vector before inserting a large number of\n components; this reduces\
            \ the amount of incremental reallocation.\n\n \n The iterators returned\
            \ by this class's iterator and\n listIterator methods are fail-fast:\n\
            \ if the vector is structurally modified at any time after the iterator\
            \ is\n created, in any way except through the iterator's own\n remove\
            \ or\n add methods, the iterator will throw a\n ConcurrentModificationException.\
            \  Thus, in the face of\n concurrent modification, the iterator fails\
            \ quickly and cleanly, rather\n than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic\
            \ behavior at an undetermined\n time in the future.  The Enumerations\
            \ returned by\n the elements method are not fail-fast; if the\n Vector\
            \ is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is\n created\
            \ then the results of enumerating are undefined.\n\n Note that the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking,\
            \ impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized\
            \ concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException\
            \ on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program\
            \ that depended on this\n exception for its correctness:  the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n As of\
            \ the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to\n implement\
            \ the List interface, making it a member of the\n \n Java Collections\
            \ Framework.  Unlike the new collection\n implementations, Vector is synchronized.\
            \  If a thread-safe\n implementation is not needed, it is recommended\
            \ to use ArrayList in place of Vector."
