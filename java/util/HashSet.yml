          notes: "This class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table\n\
            \ (actually a HashMap instance).  It makes no guarantees as to the\n iteration\
            \ order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the\n order\
            \ will remain constant over time.  This class permits the null\n element.\n\
            \n This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations\n\
            \ (add, remove, contains and size),\n assuming the hash function disperses\
            \ the elements properly among the\n buckets.  Iterating over this set\
            \ requires time proportional to the sum of\n the HashSet instance's size\
            \ (the number of elements) plus the\n \"capacity\" of the backing HashMap\
            \ instance (the number of\n buckets).  Thus, it's very important not to\
            \ set the initial capacity too\n high (or the load factor too low) if\
            \ iteration performance is important.\n\n Note that this implementation\
            \ is not synchronized.\n If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently,\
            \ and at least one of\n the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized\
            \ externally.\n This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some\
            \ object that\n naturally encapsulates the set.\n\n If no such object\
            \ exists, the set should be \"wrapped\" using the\n Collections.synchronizedSet\n\
            \ method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental\n\
            \ unsynchronized access to the set:\n   Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new\
            \ HashSet(...));\n\n The iterators returned by this class's iterator method\
            \ are\n fail-fast: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator\
            \ is\n created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove\n\
            \ method, the Iterator throws a ConcurrentModificationException.\n Thus,\
            \ in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly\n\
            \ and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior\
            \ at\n an undetermined time in the future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking,\
            \ impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized\
            \ concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException\
            \ on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program\
            \ that depended on this\n exception for its correctness: the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n This\
            \ class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
