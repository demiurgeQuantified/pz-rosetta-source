          notes: "This class provides skeletal implementations of some Queue\n operations.\
            \ The implementations in this class are appropriate when\n the base implementation\
            \ does not allow null\n elements.  Methods add, remove, and\n element\
            \ are based on offer, poll, and peek, respectively, but throw\n exceptions\
            \ instead of indicating failure via false or\n null returns.\n\n A Queue\
            \ implementation that extends this class must\n minimally define a method\
            \ Queue.offer(E) which does not permit\n insertion of null elements, along\
            \ with methods Queue.peek(), Queue.poll(), Collection.size(), and\n Collection.iterator().\
            \  Typically, additional methods will be\n overridden as well.  If these\
            \ requirements cannot be met, consider\n instead subclassing AbstractCollection.\n\
            \n This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
