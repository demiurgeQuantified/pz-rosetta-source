          notes: "Resizable-array implementation of the List interface.  Implements\n\
            \ all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including\n\
            \ null.  In addition to implementing the List interface,\n this class\
            \ provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is\n used\
            \ internally to store the list.  (This class is roughly equivalent to\n\
            \ Vector, except that it is unsynchronized.)\n\n The size, isEmpty, get,\
            \ set,\n iterator, and listIterator operations run in constant\n time.\
            \  The add operation runs in amortized constant time,\n that is, adding\
            \ n elements requires O(n) time.  All of the other operations\n run in\
            \ linear time (roughly speaking).  The constant factor is low compared\n\
            \ to that for the LinkedList implementation.\n\n Each ArrayList instance\
            \ has a capacity.  The capacity is\n the size of the array used to store\
            \ the elements in the list.  It is always\n at least as large as the list\
            \ size.  As elements are added to an ArrayList,\n its capacity grows automatically.\
            \  The details of the growth policy are not\n specified beyond the fact\
            \ that adding an element has constant amortized\n time cost.\n\n An application\
            \ can increase the capacity of an ArrayList instance\n before adding a\
            \ large number of elements using the ensureCapacity\n operation.  This\
            \ may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.\n\n Note that this\
            \ implementation is not synchronized.\n If multiple threads access an\
            \ ArrayList instance concurrently,\n and at least one of the threads modifies\
            \ the list structurally, it\n must be synchronized externally.  (A structural\
            \ modification is\n any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements,\
            \ or explicitly\n resizes the backing array; merely setting the value\
            \ of an element is not\n a structural modification.)  This is typically\
            \ accomplished by\n synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates\
            \ the list.\n\n If no such object exists, the list should be \"wrapped\"\
            \ using the\n Collections.synchronizedList\n method.  This is best done\
            \ at creation time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized access to the\
            \ list:\n   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList(...));\n\
            \n \n The iterators returned by this class's iterator and\n listIterator\
            \ methods are fail-fast:\n if the list is structurally modified at any\
            \ time after the iterator is\n created, in any way except through the\
            \ iterator's own\n remove or\n add methods, the iterator will throw a\n\
            \ ConcurrentModificationException.  Thus, in the face of\n concurrent\
            \ modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather\n than\
            \ risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined\n time\
            \ in the future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot\
            \ be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any\
            \ hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.\
            \  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort\
            \ basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended\
            \ on this\n exception for its correctness:  the fail-fast behavior of\
            \ iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n This class is a\
            \ member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."

              \ modified in\n any way other than via the returned list.  (Structural\
