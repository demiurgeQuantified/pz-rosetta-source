          notes: "GregorianCalendar is a concrete subclass of\n Calendar and provides\
            \ the standard calendar system\n used by most of the world.\n\n  GregorianCalendar\
            \ is a hybrid calendar that\n supports both the Julian and Gregorian calendar\
            \ systems with the\n support of a single discontinuity, which corresponds\
            \ by default to\n the Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted\n\
            \ (October 15, 1582 in some countries, later in others).  The cutover\n\
            \ date may be changed by the caller by calling setGregorianChange().\n\
            \n \n Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar\
            \ first,\n October 4, 1582 (Julian) was thus followed by October 15, 1582\
            \ (Gregorian). This calendar models\n this correctly.  Before the Gregorian\
            \ cutover, GregorianCalendar\n implements the Julian calendar.  The only\
            \ difference between the Gregorian\n and the Julian calendar is the leap\
            \ year rule. The Julian calendar specifies\n leap years every four years,\
            \ whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century\n years which are not divisible\
            \ by 400.\n\n \n GregorianCalendar implements proleptic Gregorian and\n\
            \ Julian calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current\n\
            \ rules indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,\n\
            \ GregorianCalendar may be used for all years to generate\n meaningful\
            \ and consistent results. However, dates obtained using\n GregorianCalendar\
            \ are historically accurate only from March 1, 4\n AD onward, when modern\
            \ Julian calendar rules were adopted.  Before this date,\n leap year rules\
            \ were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian\n calendar did\
            \ not even exist.\n\n \n Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar,\
            \ New Year's Day was\n March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always\
            \ uses January 1. A manual\n adjustment may be made if desired for dates\
            \ that are prior to the Gregorian\n changeover and which fall between\
            \ January 1 and March 24.\n\n Week Of Year and Week Year\n\n Values calculated\
            \ for the WEEK_OF_YEAR field range from 1 to 53. The first week of a\n\
            \ calendar year is the earliest seven day period starting on getFirstDayOfWeek()\
            \ that contains at\n least getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() days from that\
            \ year. It thus depends\n on the values of getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(),\
            \ \n getFirstDayOfWeek(), and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks\n\
            \ between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year\n (exclusive)\
            \ are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except\n for year(s) involved\
            \ in the Julian-Gregorian transition).\n\n The getFirstDayOfWeek() and\
            \ \n getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() values are initialized using\n locale-dependent\
            \ resources when constructing a \n GregorianCalendar. The week\n determination\
            \ is compatible with the ISO 8601 standard when \n getFirstDayOfWeek()\
            \ is MONDAY and \n getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is 4, which values are\
            \ used in locales\n where the standard is preferred. These values can\
            \ explicitly be set by\n calling setFirstDayOfWeek() and\n setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek().\n\
            \n A week year is in sync with a\n WEEK_OF_YEAR cycle. All weeks between\
            \ the first and last\n weeks (inclusive) have the same week year value.\n\
            \ Therefore, the first and last days of a week year may have\n different\
            \ calendar year values.\n\n For example, January 1, 1998 is a Thursday.\
            \ If \n getFirstDayOfWeek() is MONDAY and \n getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()\
            \ is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible\n setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts\
            \ on December 29, 1997, and ends\n on January 4, 1998. The week year is\
            \ 1998 for the last three days\n of calendar year 1997. If, however, getFirstDayOfWeek()\
            \ is\n SUNDAY, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and\n ends\
            \ on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are\n part of\
            \ week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.\n\n Week Of Month\n\n Values\
            \ calculated for the WEEK_OF_MONTH field range from 0\n to 6.  Week 1\
            \ of a month (the days with WEEK_OF_MONTH =\n 1) is the earliest set of\
            \ at least\n getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() contiguous days in that month,\n\
            \ ending on the day before getFirstDayOfWeek().  Unlike\n week 1 of a\
            \ year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need\n not start\
            \ on getFirstDayOfWeek(), and will not include days of\n the previous\
            \ month.  Days of a month before week 1 have a\n WEEK_OF_MONTH of 0.\n\
            \n For example, if getFirstDayOfWeek() is SUNDAY\n and getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()\
            \ is 4, then the first week of\n January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through\
            \ Saturday, January 10.  These days\n have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 1.  Thursday,\
            \ January 1 through\n Saturday, January 3 have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 0. \
            \ If\n getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is changed to 3, then January 1\n through\
            \ January 3 have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 1.\n\n Default Fields Values\n\n The\
            \ clear method sets calendar field(s)\n undefined. GregorianCalendar uses\
            \ the following\n default value for each calendar field if its value is\
            \ undefined.\n\n \n GregorianCalendar default field values\n   \n    \

              \ together with add rule 1,\n the resultant date must be between Tuesday\

              \ the\n closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first\
