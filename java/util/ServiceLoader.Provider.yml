              notes: The provider type
            notes: "Returns the provider type. There is no guarantee that this type\
              \ is\n accessible or that it has a public no-args constructor. The get()\
              \ method should be used to obtain the provider instance.\n\n  When a\
              \ module declares that the provider class is created by a\n provider\
              \ factory then this method returns the return type of its\n public static\
              \ \"provider()\" method."
