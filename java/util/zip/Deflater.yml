          notes: "This class provides support for general purpose compression using\
            \ the\n popular ZLIB compression library. The ZLIB compression library\
            \ was\n initially developed as part of the PNG graphics standard and is\
            \ not\n protected by patents. It is fully described in the specifications\
            \ at\n the java.util.zip\n package description.\n \n This class deflates\
            \ sequences of bytes into ZLIB compressed data format.\n The input byte\
            \ sequence is provided in either byte array or byte buffer,\n via one\
            \ of the setInput() methods. The output byte sequence is\n written to\
            \ the output byte array or byte buffer passed to the\n deflate() methods.\n\
            \ \n The following code fragment demonstrates a trivial compression\n\
            \ and decompression of a string using Deflater and\n Inflater.\n\n \n\
            \ try {\n     // Encode a String into bytes\n     String inputString =\
            \ \"blahblahblah\";\n     byte[] input = inputString.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"\
            );\n\n     // Compress the bytes\n     byte[] output = new byte[100];\n\
            \     Deflater compresser = new Deflater();\n     compresser.setInput(input);\n\
            \     compresser.finish();\n     int compressedDataLength = compresser.deflate(output);\n\
            \     compresser.end();\n\n     // Decompress the bytes\n     Inflater\
            \ decompresser = new Inflater();\n     decompresser.setInput(output, 0,\
            \ compressedDataLength);\n     byte[] result = new byte[100];\n     int\
            \ resultLength = decompresser.inflate(result);\n     decompresser.end();\n\
