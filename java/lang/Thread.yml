          notes: "A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java\n Virtual\
            \ Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of\n execution\
            \ running concurrently.\n \n Every thread has a priority. Threads with\
            \ higher priority are\n executed in preference to threads with lower priority.\
            \ Each thread\n may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running\
            \ in\n some thread creates a new Thread object, the new\n thread has its\
            \ priority initially set equal to the priority of the\n creating thread,\
            \ and is a daemon thread if and only if the\n creating thread is a daemon.\n\
            \ \n When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single\n\
            \ non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named\n main of\
            \ some designated class). The Java Virtual\n Machine continues to execute\
            \ threads until either of the following\n occurs:\n \n The exit method\
            \ of class Runtime has been\n     called and the security manager has\
            \ permitted the exit operation\n     to take place.\n All threads that\
            \ are not daemon threads have died, either by\n     returning from the\
            \ call to the run method or by\n     throwing an exception that propagates\
            \ beyond the run\n     method.\n \n \n There are two ways to create a\
            \ new thread of execution. One is to\n declare a class to be a subclass\
            \ of Thread. This\n subclass should override the run method of class\n\
            \ Thread. An instance of the subclass can then be\n allocated and started.\
            \ For example, a thread that computes primes\n larger than a stated value\
            \ could be written as follows:\n \n     class PrimeThread extends Thread\
            \ {\n         long minPrime;\n         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {\n\
            \             this.minPrime = minPrime;\n         }\n\n         public\
            \ void run() {\n             // compute primes larger than minPrime\n\
            \              . . .\n         }\n     }\n \n \n The following code would\
            \ then create a thread and start it running:\n \n     PrimeThread p =\
            \ new PrimeThread(143);\n     p.start();\n \n \n The other way to create\
            \ a thread is to declare a class that\n implements the Runnable interface.\
            \ That class then\n implements the run method. An instance of the class\
            \ can\n then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating\n Thread,\
            \ and started. The same example in this other\n style looks like the following:\n\
            \ \n     class PrimeRun implements Runnable {\n         long minPrime;\n\
            \         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {\n             this.minPrime = minPrime;\n\
            \         }\n\n         public void run() {\n             // compute primes\
            \ larger than minPrime\n              . . .\n         }\n     }\n \n \n\
            \ The following code would then create a thread and start it running:\n\
            \ \n     PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);\n     new Thread(p).start();\n\
            \ \n \n Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than\n\
            \ one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when\n\
            \ a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.\n \n Unless otherwise\
            \ noted, passing a null argument to a constructor\n or method in this\
            \ class will cause a NullPointerException to be\n thrown."

              \ This constructor is identical to Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)\
              \ with the exception of the fact\n that it allows the thread stack size\
              \ to be specified.  The stack size\n is the approximate number of bytes\
              \ of address space that the virtual\n machine is to allocate for this\
              \ thread's stack.  The effect of the\n stackSize parameter, if any,\
              \ is highly platform dependent.\n\n On some platforms, specifying a\
              \ higher value for the\n stackSize parameter may allow a thread to achieve\
              \ greater\n recursion depth before throwing a StackOverflowError.\n\
              \ Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of\n\
              \ threads to exist concurrently without throwing an OutOfMemoryError\
              \ (or other internal error).  The details of\n the relationship between\
              \ the value of the stackSize parameter\n and the maximum recursion depth\
              \ and concurrency level are\n platform-dependent.  On some platforms,\
              \ the value of the\n stackSize parameter may have no effect whatsoever.\n\
              \n The virtual machine is free to treat the stackSize\n parameter as\
              \ a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low\n for the\
              \ platform, the virtual machine may instead use some\n platform-specific\
              \ minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably\n high, the\
              \ virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific\n maximum.\
              \  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified\n value\
              \ up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).\n\n Specifying\
              \ a value of zero for the stackSize parameter will\n cause this constructor\
              \ to behave exactly like the\n Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)\
              \ constructor.\n\n Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior\
              \ of this\n constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.\n\
              \ The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will\n\
              \ likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this\n\
              \ variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,\n\
              \ and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation\
              \ on\n which an application is to run.\n\n Implementation note: Java\
