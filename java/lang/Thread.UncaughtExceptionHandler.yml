          notes: "Interface for handlers invoked when a Thread abruptly\n terminates\
            \ due to an uncaught exception.\n When a thread is about to terminate\
            \ due to an uncaught exception\n the Java Virtual Machine will query the\
            \ thread for its\n UncaughtExceptionHandler using\n Thread.getUncaughtExceptionHandler()\
            \ and will invoke the handler's\n uncaughtException method, passing the\
            \ thread and the\n exception as arguments.\n If a thread has not had its\
            \ UncaughtExceptionHandler\n explicitly set, then its ThreadGroup object\
            \ acts as its\n UncaughtExceptionHandler. If the ThreadGroup object\n\
            \ has no\n special requirements for dealing with the exception, it can\
            \ forward\n the invocation to the default uncaught exception handler."
