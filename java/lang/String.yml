          notes: "The String class represents character strings. All\n string literals\
            \ in Java programs, such as \"abc\", are\n implemented as instances of\
            \ this class.\n \n Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed\
            \ after they\n are created. String buffers support mutable strings.\n\
            \ Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:\n\
            \ \n     String str = \"abc\";\n \n is equivalent to:\n \n     char data[]\
            \ = {'a', 'b', 'c'};\n     String str = new String(data);\n \n Here are\
            \ some more examples of how strings can be used:\n \n     System.out.println(\"\
            abc\");\n     String cde = \"cde\";\n     System.out.println(\"abc\" +\
            \ cde);\n     String c = \"abc\".substring(2, 3);\n     String d = cde.substring(1,\
            \ 2);\n \n \n The class String includes methods for examining\n individual\
            \ characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for\n searching strings,\
            \ for extracting substrings, and for creating a\n copy of a string with\
            \ all characters translated to uppercase or to\n lowercase. Case mapping\
            \ is based on the Unicode Standard version\n specified by the Character\
            \ class.\n \n The Java language provides special support for the string\n\
            \ concatenation operator ( + ), and for conversion of\n other objects\
            \ to strings. For additional information on string\n concatenation and\
            \ conversion, see The Java Language Specification.\n\n  Unless otherwise\
            \ noted, passing a null argument to a constructor\n or method in this\
            \ class will cause a NullPointerException to be\n thrown.\n\n A String\
            \ represents a string in the UTF-16 format\n in which supplementary characters\
            \ are represented by surrogate\n pairs (see the section Unicode\n Character\
            \ Representations in the Character class for\n more information).\n Index\
            \ values refer to char code units, so a supplementary\n character uses\
            \ two positions in a String.\n The String class provides methods for dealing\
            \ with\n Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those\
            \ for\n dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., char values).\n\n Unless\
            \ otherwise noted, methods for comparing Strings do not take locale\n\
            \ into account.  The Collator class provides methods for\n finer-grain,\
            \ locale-sensitive String comparison."

              \ as follows:\n \n   For each non-blank line (as defined by isBlank()),\n\

              \ are\n removed, and any trailing white\n space characters are removed.\
