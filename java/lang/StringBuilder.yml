          notes: "A mutable sequence of characters.  This class provides an API compatible\n\
            \ with StringBuffer, but with no guarantee of synchronization.\n This\
            \ class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for\n StringBuffer\
            \ in places where the string buffer was being\n used by a single thread\
            \ (as is generally the case).   Where possible,\n it is recommended that\
            \ this class be used in preference to\n StringBuffer as it will be faster\
            \ under most implementations.\n\n The principal operations on a StringBuilder\
            \ are the\n append and insert methods, which are\n overloaded so as to\
            \ accept data of any type. Each effectively\n converts a given datum to\
            \ a string and then appends or inserts the\n characters of that string\
            \ to the string builder. The\n append method always adds these characters\
            \ at the end\n of the builder; the insert method adds the characters at\n\
            \ a specified point.\n \n For example, if z refers to a string builder\
            \ object\n whose current contents are \"start\", then\n the method call\
            \ z.append(\"le\") would cause the string\n builder to contain \"startle\"\
            , whereas\n z.insert(4, \"le\") would alter the string builder to\n contain\
            \ \"starlet\".\n \n In general, if sb refers to an instance of a StringBuilder,\n\
            \ then sb.append(x) has the same effect as\n sb.insert(sb.length(), x).\n\
            \ \n Every string builder has a capacity. As long as the length of the\n\
            \ character sequence contained in the string builder does not exceed\n\
            \ the capacity, it is not necessary to allocate a new internal\n buffer.\
            \ If the internal buffer overflows, it is automatically made larger.\n\
            \n Instances of StringBuilder are not safe for\n use by multiple threads.\
            \ If such synchronization is required then it is\n recommended that StringBuffer\
            \ be used.\n\n Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor\n\
            \ or method in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be\n thrown."
