          notes: "The abstract class Number is the superclass of platform\n classes\
            \ representing numeric values that are convertible to the\n primitive\
            \ types byte, double, float, \n int, long, and short.\n\n The specific\
            \ semantics of the conversion from the numeric value of\n a particular\
            \ Number implementation to a given primitive\n type is defined by the\
            \ Number implementation in question.\n\n For platform classes, the conversion\
            \ is often analogous to a\n narrowing primitive conversion or a widening\
            \ primitive conversion\n as defined in The Java Language Specification\n\
            \ for converting between primitive types.  Therefore, conversions may\n\
            \ lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value, may\n\
            \ lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign\n than\
            \ the input.\n\n See the documentation of a given Number implementation\
            \ for\n conversion details."
