          notes: "The Character class wraps a value of the primitive\n type char in\
            \ an object. An object of class\n Character contains a single field whose\
            \ type is\n char.\n \n In addition, this class provides a large number\
            \ of static methods for\n determining a character's category (lowercase\
            \ letter, digit, etc.)\n and for converting characters from uppercase\
            \ to lowercase and vice\n versa.\n\n Unicode Conformance\n \n The fields\
            \ and methods of class Character are defined in terms\n of character information\
            \ from the Unicode Standard, specifically the\n UnicodeData file that\
            \ is part of the Unicode Character Database.\n This file specifies properties\
            \ including name and category for every\n assigned Unicode code point\
            \ or character range. The file is available\n from the Unicode Consortium\
            \ at\n http://www.unicode.org.\n \n Character information is based on\
            \ the Unicode Standard, version 13.0.\n \n The Java platform has supported\
            \ different versions of the Unicode\n Standard over time. Upgrades to\
            \ newer versions of the Unicode Standard\n occurred in the following Java\
            \ releases, each indicating the new version:\n \n Shows Java releases\

            \ \n Variations from these base Unicode versions, such as recognized appendixes,\n\
            \ are documented elsewhere.\n Unicode Character Representations\n\n The\
            \ char data type (and therefore the value that a\n Character object encapsulates)\
            \ are based on the\n original Unicode specification, which defined characters\
            \ as\n fixed-width 16-bit entities. The Unicode Standard has since been\n\
            \ changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more\n\
            \ than 16 bits.  The range of legal code points is now\n U+0000 to U+10FFFF,\
            \ known as Unicode scalar value.\n (Refer to the \n definition of the\
            \ U+n notation in the Unicode\n Standard.)\n\n The set of characters from\
            \ U+0000 to U+FFFF is\n sometimes referred to as the Basic Multilingual\
            \ Plane (BMP).\n Characters whose code points are greater\n than U+FFFF\
            \ are called supplementary characters.  The Java\n platform uses the UTF-16\
            \ representation in char arrays and\n in the String and StringBuffer classes.\
            \ In\n this representation, supplementary characters are represented as\
            \ a pair\n of char values, the first from the high-surrogates\n range,\
            \ (&#92;uD800-&#92;uDBFF), the second from the\n low-surrogates range\
            \ (&#92;uDC00-&#92;uDFFF).\n\n A char value, therefore, represents Basic\n\
            \ Multilingual Plane (BMP) code points, including the surrogate\n code\
            \ points, or code units of the UTF-16 encoding. An\n int value represents\
            \ all Unicode code points,\n including supplementary code points. The\
            \ lower (least significant)\n 21 bits of int are used to represent Unicode\
            \ code\n points and the upper (most significant) 11 bits must be zero.\n\
            \ Unless otherwise specified, the behavior with respect to\n supplementary\
            \ characters and surrogate char values is\n as follows:\n\n \n The methods\
            \ that only accept a char value cannot support\n supplementary characters.\
            \ They treat char values from the\n surrogate ranges as undefined characters.\
            \ For example,\n Character.isLetter('\\uD840') returns false, even though\n\
            \ this specific value if followed by any low-surrogate value in a string\n\
            \ would represent a letter.\n\n The methods that accept an int value support\
            \ all\n Unicode characters, including supplementary characters. For\n\
            \ example, Character.isLetter(0x2F81A) returns\n true because the code\
            \ point value represents a letter\n (a CJK ideograph).\n \n\n In the Java\
            \ SE API documentation, Unicode code point is\n used for character values\
            \ in the range between U+0000 and U+10FFFF,\n and Unicode code unit is\
            \ used for 16-bit\n char values that are code units of the UTF-16\n encoding.\
            \ For more information on Unicode terminology, refer to the\n Unicode\
            \ Glossary.\n\n This is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat\
            \ instances that are\n equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances\
            \ for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example,\
            \ in a future release, synchronization may fail."
