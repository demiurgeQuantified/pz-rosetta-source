          notes: "This is the common base class of all Java language enumeration classes.\n\
            \n More information about enums, including descriptions of the\n implicitly\
            \ declared methods synthesized by the compiler, can be\n found in section\
            \ 8.9 of The Java Language\n Specification.\n\n Enumeration classes are\
            \ all serializable and receive special handling\n by the serialization\
            \ mechanism. The serialized representation used\n for enum constants cannot\
            \ be customized. Declarations of methods\n and fields that would otherwise\
            \ interact with serialization are\n ignored, including serialVersionUID;\
            \ see the Java\n Object Serialization Specification for details.\n\n \
            \ Note that when using an enumeration type as the type of a set\n or as\
            \ the type of the keys in a map, specialized and efficient\n set and map\
            \ implementations are available."
