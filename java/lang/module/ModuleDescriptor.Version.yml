          notes: "A module's version string.\n\n  A version string has three components:\
            \ The version number itself, an\n optional pre-release version, and an\
            \ optional build version.  Each\n component is a sequence of tokens; each\
            \ token is either a non-negative\n integer or a string.  Tokens are separated\
            \ by the punctuation characters\n '.', '-', or '+', or by transitions\
            \ from a\n sequence of digits to a sequence of characters that are neither\
            \ digits\n nor punctuation characters, or vice versa.\n\n \n\n    The\
            \ version number is a sequence of tokens separated by\n   '.' characters,\
            \ terminated by the first '-' or \n   '+' character. \n\n    The pre-release\
            \ version is a sequence of tokens separated\n   by '.' or '-' characters,\
            \ terminated by the first\n   '+' character. \n\n    The build version\
            \ is a sequence of tokens separated by\n   '.', '-', or '+' characters.\n\
            \n \n\n  When comparing two version strings, the elements of their\n corresponding\
            \ components are compared in pointwise fashion.  If one\n component is\
            \ longer than the other, but otherwise equal to it, then the\n first component\
            \ is considered the greater of the two; otherwise, if two\n corresponding\
            \ elements are integers then they are compared as such;\n otherwise, at\
            \ least one of the elements is a string, so the other is\n converted into\
            \ a string if it is an integer and the two are compared\n lexicographically.\
            \  Trailing integer elements with the value zero are\n ignored.\n\n  Given\
            \ two version strings, if their version numbers differ then the\n result\
            \ of comparing them is the result of comparing their version\n numbers;\
            \ otherwise, if one of them has a pre-release version but the\n other\
            \ does not then the first is considered to precede the second,\n otherwise\
            \ the result of comparing them is the result of comparing their\n pre-release\
            \ versions; otherwise, the result of comparing them is the\n result of\
            \ comparing their build versions."
