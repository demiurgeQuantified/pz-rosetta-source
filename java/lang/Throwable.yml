          notes: "The Throwable class is the superclass of all errors and\n exceptions\
            \ in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this\n class\
            \ (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or\n\
            \ can be thrown by the Java throw statement. Similarly, only\n this class\
            \ or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in a\n catch clause.\n\
            \n For the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions, \n Throwable\
            \ and any subclass of Throwable that is not also a\n subclass of either\
            \ RuntimeException or Error are\n regarded as checked exceptions.\n\n\
            \ Instances of two subclasses, Error and\n Exception, are conventionally\
            \ used to indicate\n that exceptional situations have occurred. Typically,\
            \ these instances\n are freshly created in the context of the exceptional\
            \ situation so\n as to include relevant information (such as stack trace\
            \ data).\n\n A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of\
            \ its\n thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message\n\
            \ string that gives more information about the error. Over time, a\n throwable\
            \ can suppress other\n throwables from being propagated.  Finally, the\
            \ throwable can also\n contain a cause: another throwable that caused\
            \ this\n throwable to be constructed.  The recording of this causal information\n\
            \ is referred to as the chained exception facility, as the\n cause can,\
            \ itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a \"chain\" of\n exceptions,\
            \ each caused by another.\n\n One reason that a throwable may have a cause\
            \ is that the class that\n throws it is built atop a lower layered abstraction,\
            \ and an operation on\n the upper layer fails due to a failure in the\
            \ lower layer.  It would be bad\n design to let the throwable thrown by\
            \ the lower layer propagate outward, as\n it is generally unrelated to\
            \ the abstraction provided by the upper layer.\n Further, doing so would\
            \ tie the API of the upper layer to the details of\n its implementation,\
            \ assuming the lower layer's exception was a checked\n exception.  Throwing\
            \ a \"wrapped exception\" (i.e., an exception containing a\n cause) allows\
            \ the upper layer to communicate the details of the failure to\n its caller\
            \ without incurring either of these shortcomings.  It preserves\n the\
            \ flexibility to change the implementation of the upper layer without\n\
            \ changing its API (in particular, the set of exceptions thrown by its\n\
            \ methods).\n\n A second reason that a throwable may have a cause is that\
            \ the method\n that throws it must conform to a general-purpose interface\
            \ that does not\n permit the method to throw the cause directly.  For\
            \ example, suppose\n a persistent collection conforms to the Collection\
            \ interface, and that its persistence is implemented atop\n java.io. \
            \ Suppose the internals of the add method\n can throw an IOException.\
            \  The implementation\n can communicate the details of the IOException\
            \ to its caller\n while conforming to the Collection interface by wrapping\
            \ the\n IOException in an appropriate unchecked exception.  (The\n specification\
            \ for the persistent collection should indicate that it is\n capable of\
            \ throwing such exceptions.)\n\n A cause can be associated with a throwable\
            \ in two ways: via a\n constructor that takes the cause as an argument,\
            \ or via the\n initCause(Throwable) method.  New throwable classes that\n\
            \ wish to allow causes to be associated with them should provide constructors\n\
            \ that take a cause and delegate (perhaps indirectly) to one of the\n\
            \ Throwable constructors that takes a cause.\n\n Because the initCause\
            \ method is public, it allows a cause to be\n associated with any throwable,\
            \ even a \"legacy throwable\" whose\n implementation predates the addition\
            \ of the exception chaining mechanism to\n Throwable.\n\n By convention,\
            \ class Throwable and its subclasses have two\n constructors, one that\
            \ takes no arguments and one that takes a\n String argument that can be\
            \ used to produce a detail message.\n Further, those subclasses that might\
            \ likely have a cause associated with\n them should have two more constructors,\
            \ one that takes a\n Throwable (the cause), and one that takes a\n String\
            \ (the detail message) and a Throwable (the\n cause)."
