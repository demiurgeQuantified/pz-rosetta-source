          notes: "This class provides thread-local variables.  These variables differ\
            \ from\n their normal counterparts in that each thread that accesses one\
            \ (via its\n get or set method) has its own, independently initialized\n\
            \ copy of the variable.  ThreadLocal instances are typically private\n\
            \ static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread\
            \ (e.g.,\n a user ID or Transaction ID).\n\n For example, the class below\
            \ generates unique identifiers local to each\n thread.\n A thread's id\
            \ is assigned the first time it invokes ThreadId.get()\n and remains unchanged\
            \ on subsequent calls.\n \n import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;\n\
            \n public class ThreadId {\n     // Atomic integer containing the next\
            \ thread ID to be assigned\n     private static final AtomicInteger nextId\
            \ = new AtomicInteger(0);\n\n     // Thread local variable containing\
            \ each thread's ID\n     private static final ThreadLocal<Integer> threadId\
            \ =\n         new ThreadLocal<Integer>() {\n             &#64;Override\
            \ protected Integer initialValue() {\n                 return nextId.getAndIncrement();\n\
            \         }\n     };\n\n     // Returns the current thread's unique ID,\
            \ assigning it if necessary\n     public static int get() {\n        \
            \ return threadId.get();\n     }\n }\n \n Each thread holds an implicit\
            \ reference to its copy of a thread-local\n variable as long as the thread\
            \ is alive and the ThreadLocal\n instance is accessible; after a thread\
            \ goes away, all of its copies of\n thread-local instances are subject\
            \ to garbage collection (unless other\n references to these copies exist)."

              \ variable.  This method will be invoked the first\n time a thread accesses\
              \ the variable with the get()\n method, unless the thread previously\
              \ invoked the set(T)\n method, in which case the initialValue method\
              \ will not\n be invoked for the thread.  Normally, this method is invoked\
              \ at\n most once per thread, but it may be invoked again in case of\n\
              \ subsequent invocations of remove() followed by get().\n\n This implementation\
              \ simply returns null; if the\n programmer desires thread-local variables\
              \ to have an initial\n value other than null, ThreadLocal must be\n\
