          notes: "A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread\n\
            \ group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form\n\
            \ a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group\n\
            \ has a parent.\n \n A thread is allowed to access information about its\
            \ own thread\n group, but not to access information about its thread group's\n\
            \ parent thread group or any other thread groups."
