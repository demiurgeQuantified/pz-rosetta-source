          notes: "Weak reference objects, which do not prevent their referents from\
            \ being\n made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed.  Weak references\
            \ are most\n often used to implement canonicalizing mappings.\n\n  Suppose\
            \ that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time\n that\
            \ an object is weakly\n reachable.  At that time it will atomically clear\
            \ all weak references to\n that object and all weak references to any\
            \ other weakly-reachable objects\n from which that object is reachable\
            \ through a chain of strong and soft\n references.  At the same time it\
            \ will declare all of the formerly\n weakly-reachable objects to be finalizable.\
            \  At the same time or at some\n later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared\
            \ weak references that are\n registered with reference queues."
