          notes: "Phantom reference objects, which are enqueued after the collector\n\
            \ determines that their referents may otherwise be reclaimed.  Phantom\n\
            \ references are most often used to schedule post-mortem cleanup actions.\n\
            \n  Suppose the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time\n\
            \ that an object is \n phantom reachable.  At that time it will atomically\
            \ clear\n all phantom references to that object and all phantom references\
            \ to\n any other phantom-reachable objects from which that object is reachable.\n\
            \ At the same time or at some later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared\n\
            \ phantom references that are registered with reference queues.\n\n  In\
            \ order to ensure that a reclaimable object remains so, the referent of\n\
            \ a phantom reference may not be retrieved: The get method of a\n phantom\
            \ reference always returns null.\n The refersTo method can be used to\
            \ test\n whether some object is the referent of a phantom reference."
