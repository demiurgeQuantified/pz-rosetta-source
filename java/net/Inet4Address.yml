          notes: "This class represents an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address.\n\
            \ Defined by \n RFC 790: Assigned Numbers,\n \n RFC 1918: Address Allocation\
            \ for Private Internets,\n and RFC 2365:\n Administratively Scoped IP\
            \ Multicast\n\n  Textual representation of IP addresses \n\n Textual representation\
            \ of IPv4 address used as input to methods\n takes one of the following\
            \ forms:\n\n \n d.d.d.d\n d.d.d\n d.d\n d\n \n\n  When four parts are\
            \ specified, each is interpreted as a byte of\n data and assigned, from\
            \ left to right, to the four bytes of an IPv4\n address.\n\n  When a three\
            \ part address is specified, the last part is\n interpreted as a 16-bit\
            \ quantity and placed in the right most two\n bytes of the network address.\
            \ This makes the three part address\n format convenient for specifying\
            \ Class B net- work addresses as\n 128.net.host.\n\n  When a two part\
            \ address is supplied, the last part is\n interpreted as a 24-bit quantity\
            \ and placed in the right most three\n bytes of the network address. This\
            \ makes the two part address\n format convenient for specifying Class\
            \ A network addresses as\n net.host.\n\n  When only one part is given,\
            \ the value is stored directly in\n the network address without any byte\
            \ rearrangement.\n\n  For methods that return a textual representation\
            \ as output\n value, the first form, i.e. a dotted-quad string, is used.\n\
            \n  The Scope of a Multicast Address \n\n Historically the IPv4 TTL field\
            \ in the IP header has doubled as a\n multicast scope field: a TTL of\
            \ 0 means node-local, 1 means\n link-local, up through 32 means site-local,\
            \ up through 64 means\n region-local, up through 128 means continent-local,\
            \ and up through\n 255 are global. However, the administrative scoping\
            \ is preferred.\n Please refer to \n RFC 2365: Administratively Scoped\
            \ IP Multicast"
