            notes: "Creates a URL object from the specified\n protocol, host, port\n\
              \ number, and file.\n\n host can be expressed as a host name or a literal\n\
              \ IP address. If IPv6 literal address is used, it should be\n enclosed\
              \ in square brackets ('[' and ']'), as\n specified by RFC 2732;\n However,\
              \ the literal IPv6 address format defined in RFC 2373: IP\n Version\
              \ 6 Addressing Architecture is also accepted.\n\n Specifying a port\
              \ number of -1\n indicates that the URL should use the default port\
              \ for the\n protocol.\n\n If this is the first URL object being created\
              \ with the specified\n protocol, a stream protocol handler object, an\
              \ instance of\n class URLStreamHandler, is created for that protocol:\n\
              \ \n If the application has previously set up an instance of\n     URLStreamHandlerFactory\
              \ as the stream handler factory,\n     then the createURLStreamHandler\
              \ method of that instance\n     is called with the protocol string as\
              \ an argument to create the\n     stream protocol handler.\n If no URLStreamHandlerFactory\
              \ has yet been set up,\n     or if the factory's createURLStreamHandler\
              \ method\n     returns null, then the ServiceLoader mechanism is used\
              \ to locate URLStreamHandlerProvider\n     implementations using the\
              \ system class\n     loader. The order that providers are located is\
              \ implementation\n     specific, and an implementation is free to cache\
              \ the located\n     providers. A ServiceConfigurationError, Error or\
              \ RuntimeException\n     thrown from the createURLStreamHandler, if\
              \ encountered, will\n     be propagated to the calling thread. The \n\
              \     createURLStreamHandler method of each provider, if instantiated,\
              \ is\n     invoked, with the protocol string, until a provider returns\
              \ non-null,\n     or all providers have been exhausted.\n If the previous\
              \ step fails to find a protocol handler, the\n     constructor reads\

              \ interpreted as a list of packages separated by a vertical\n     slash\

              \     \n         <package>.<protocol>.Handler\n     \n     where <package>\
              \ is replaced by the name of the package\n     and <protocol> is replaced\
              \ by the name of the protocol.\n     If this class does not exist, or\
              \ if the class exists but it is not\n     a subclass of URLStreamHandler,\
              \ then the next package\n     in the list is tried.\n If the previous\
              \ step fails to find a protocol handler, then the\n     constructor\
              \ tries to load a built-in protocol handler.\n     If this class does\
              \ not exist, or if the class exists but it is not a\n     subclass of\
              \ URLStreamHandler, then a\n     MalformedURLException is thrown.\n\

              \ handlers, for example those used for loading platform\n classes or\

              \ such restrictions, and when those restrictions apply (during\n initialization\
