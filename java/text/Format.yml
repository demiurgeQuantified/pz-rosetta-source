          notes: "Format is an abstract base class for formatting locale-sensitive\n\
            \ information such as dates, messages, and numbers.\n\n \n Format defines\
            \ the programming interface for formatting\n locale-sensitive objects\
            \ into Strings (the\n format method) and for parsing Strings back\n into\
            \ objects (the parseObject method).\n\n \n Generally, a format's parseObject\
            \ method must be able to parse\n any string formatted by its format method.\
            \ However, there may\n be exceptional cases where this is not possible.\
            \ For example, a\n format method might create two adjacent integer numbers\
            \ with\n no separator in between, and in this case the parseObject could\n\
            \ not tell which digits belong to which number.\n\n Subclassing\n\n \n\
            \ The Java Platform provides three specialized subclasses of Format--\n\
            \ DateFormat, MessageFormat, and\n NumberFormat--for formatting dates,\
            \ messages, and numbers,\n respectively.\n \n Concrete subclasses must\
            \ implement three methods:\n \n  format(Object obj, StringBuffer toAppendTo,\
            \ FieldPosition pos)\n  formatToCharacterIterator(Object obj)\n  parseObject(String\
            \ source, ParsePosition pos)\n \n These general methods allow polymorphic\
            \ parsing and formatting of objects\n and are used, for example, by MessageFormat.\n\
            \ Subclasses often also provide additional format methods for\n specific\
            \ input types as well as parse methods for specific\n result types. Any\
            \ parse method that does not take a\n ParsePosition argument should throw\
            \ ParseException\n when no text in the required format is at the beginning\
            \ of the input text.\n\n \n Most subclasses will also implement the following\
            \ factory methods:\n \n \n getInstance for getting a useful format object\
            \ appropriate\n for the current locale\n \n getInstance(Locale) for getting\
            \ a useful format\n object appropriate for the specified locale\n \n In\
            \ addition, some subclasses may also implement other\n getXxxxInstance\
            \ methods for more specialized control. For\n example, the NumberFormat\
            \ class provides\n getPercentInstance and getCurrencyInstance\n methods\
            \ for getting specialized number formatters.\n\n \n Subclasses of Format\
            \ that allow programmers to create objects\n for locales (with getInstance(Locale)\
            \ for example)\n must also implement the following class method:\n \n\
            \ \n public static Locale[] getAvailableLocales()\n \n \n\n \n And finally\
            \ subclasses may define a set of constants to identify the various\n fields\
            \ in the formatted output. These constants are used to create a FieldPosition\n\
            \ object which identifies what information is contained in the field and\
            \ its\n position in the formatted result. These constants should be named\n\
            \ item_FIELD where item identifies\n the field. For examples of these\
            \ constants, see ERA_FIELD and its\n friends in DateFormat.\n\n Synchronization\n\
            \n \n Formats are generally not synchronized.\n It is recommended to create\
            \ separate format instances for each thread.\n If multiple threads access\
            \ a format concurrently, it must be synchronized\n externally."
