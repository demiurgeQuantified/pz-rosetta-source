          notes: "The Collator class performs locale-sensitive\n String comparison.\
            \ You use this class to build\n searching and sorting routines for natural\
            \ language text.\n\n \n Collator is an abstract base class. Subclasses\n\
            \ implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,\n RuleBasedCollator,\
            \ is currently provided with\n the Java Platform and is applicable to\
            \ a wide set of languages. Other\n subclasses may be created to handle\
            \ more specialized needs.\n\n \n Like other locale-sensitive classes,\
            \ you can use the static\n factory method, getInstance, to obtain the\
            \ appropriate\n Collator object for a given locale. You will only need\n\
            \ to look at the subclasses of Collator if you need\n to understand the\
            \ details of a particular collation strategy or\n if you need to modify\
            \ that strategy.\n\n \n The following example shows how to compare two\
            \ strings using\n the Collator for the default locale.\n \n <code>\n //\
            \ Compare two strings in the default locale\n Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();\n\
            \ if( myCollator.compare(\"abc\", \"ABC\") < 0 )\n     System.out.println(\"\
            abc is less than ABC\");\n else\n     System.out.println(\"abc is greater\
            \ than or equal to ABC\");\n </code>\n \n\n \n You can set a Collator's\
            \ strength property\n to determine the level of difference considered\
            \ significant in\n comparisons. Four strengths are provided: PRIMARY,\n\
            \ SECONDARY, TERTIARY, and IDENTICAL.\n The exact assignment of strengths\
            \ to language features is\n locale dependent.  For example, in Czech,\
            \ \"e\" and \"f\" are considered\n primary differences, while \"e\" and\
            \ \"&#283;\" are secondary differences,\n \"e\" and \"E\" are tertiary\
            \ differences and \"e\" and \"e\" are identical.\n The following shows\
            \ how both case and accents could be ignored for\n US English.\n \n \n\
            \ //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY\n\
            \ Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);\n usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);\n\
            \ if( usCollator.compare(\"abc\", \"ABC\") == 0 ) {\n     System.out.println(\"\
            Strings are equivalent\");\n }\n \n \n \n For comparing Strings exactly\
            \ once, the compare\n method provides the best performance. When sorting\
            \ a list of\n Strings however, it is generally necessary to compare each\n\
            \ String multiple times. In this case, CollationKeys\n provide better\
            \ performance. The CollationKey class converts\n a String to a series\
            \ of bits that can be compared bitwise\n against other CollationKeys.\
            \ A CollationKey is\n created by a Collator object for a given String.\n\
            \ \n Note: CollationKeys from different\n Collators can not be compared.\
            \ See the class description\n for CollationKey\n for an example using\
            \ CollationKeys."
