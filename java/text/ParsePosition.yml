          notes: "ParsePosition is a simple class used by Format\n and its subclasses\
            \ to keep track of the current position during parsing.\n The parseObject\
            \ method in the various Format\n classes requires a ParsePosition object\
            \ as an argument.\n\n \n By design, as you parse through a string with\
            \ different formats,\n you can use the same ParsePosition, since the index\
            \ parameter\n records the current position."
