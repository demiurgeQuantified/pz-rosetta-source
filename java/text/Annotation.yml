          notes: "An Annotation object is used as a wrapper for a text attribute value\
            \ if\n the attribute has annotation characteristics. These characteristics\
            \ are:\n \n The text range that the attribute is applied to is critical\
            \ to the\n semantics of the range. That means, the attribute cannot be\
            \ applied to subranges\n of the text range that it applies to, and, if\
            \ two adjacent text ranges have\n the same value for this attribute, the\
            \ attribute still cannot be applied to\n the combined range as a whole\
            \ with this value.\n The attribute or its value usually do no longer apply\
            \ if the underlying text is\n changed.\n \n\n An example is grammatical\
            \ information attached to a sentence:\n For the previous sentence, you\
            \ can say that \"an example\"\n is the subject, but you cannot say the\
            \ same about \"an\", \"example\", or \"exam\".\n When the text is changed,\
            \ the grammatical information typically becomes invalid.\n Another example\
            \ is Japanese reading information (yomi).\n\n \n Wrapping the attribute\
            \ value into an Annotation object guarantees that\n adjacent text runs\
            \ don't get merged even if the attribute values are equal,\n and indicates\
            \ to text containers that the attribute should be discarded if\n the underlying\
            \ text is modified."
