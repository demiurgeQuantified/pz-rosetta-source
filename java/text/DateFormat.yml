          notes: "DateFormat is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses\
            \ which\n formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner.\n\
            \ The date/time formatting subclass, such as SimpleDateFormat, allows\
            \ for\n formatting (i.e., date &rarr; text), parsing (text &rarr; date),\
            \ and\n normalization.  The date is represented as a Date object or\n\
            \ as the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.\n\n DateFormat\
            \ provides many class methods for obtaining default date/time\n formatters\
            \ based on the default or a given locale and a number of formatting\n\
            \ styles. The formatting styles include FULL, LONG, MEDIUM, and SHORT.\
            \ More\n detail and examples of using these styles are provided in the\
            \ method\n descriptions.\n\n DateFormat helps you to format and parse\
            \ dates for any locale.\n Your code can be completely independent of the\
            \ locale conventions for\n months, days of the week, or even the calendar\
            \ format: lunar vs. solar.\n\n To format a date for the current Locale,\
            \ use one of the\n static factory methods:\n \n <code>\n myString = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(myDate);\n\
            \ </code>\n \n If you are formatting multiple dates, it is\n more efficient\
            \ to get the format and use it multiple times so that\n the system doesn't\
            \ have to fetch the information about the local\n language and country\
            \ conventions multiple times.\n \n <code>\n DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance();\n\
            \ for (int i = 0; i < myDate.length; ++i) {\n     output.println(df.format(myDate[i])\
            \ + \"; \");\n }\n </code>\n \n To format a date for a different Locale,\
            \ specify it in the\n call to getDateInstance().\n \n <code>\n DateFormat\
            \ df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, Locale.FRANCE);\n </code>\n\
            \ \n\n If the specified locale contains \"ca\" (calendar), \"rg\" (region\
            \ override),\n and/or \"tz\" (timezone) Unicode\n extensions, the calendar,\
            \ the country and/or the time zone for formatting\n are overridden. If\
            \ both \"ca\" and \"rg\" are specified, the calendar from the \"ca\"\n\
            \ extension supersedes the implicit one from the \"rg\" extension.\n\n\
            \ You can use a DateFormat to parse also.\n \n <code>\n myDate = df.parse(myString);\n\
            \ </code>\n \n Use getDateInstance to get the normal date format for that\
            \ country.\n There are other static factory methods available.\n Use getTimeInstance\
            \ to get the time format for that country.\n Use getDateTimeInstance to\
            \ get a date and time format. You can pass in\n different options to these\
            \ factory methods to control the length of the\n result; from SHORT to\
            \ MEDIUM to LONG to FULL. The exact result depends\n on the locale, but\
            \ generally:\n SHORT is completely numeric, such as 12.13.52 or 3:30pm\n\
            \ MEDIUM is longer, such as Jan 12, 1952\n LONG is longer, such as January\
            \ 12, 1952 or 3:30:32pm\n FULL is pretty completely specified, such as\n\
            \ Tuesday, April 12, 1952 AD or 3:30:42pm PST.\n \n\n You can also set\
            \ the time zone on the format if you wish.\n If you want even more control\
            \ over the format or parsing,\n (or want to give your users more control),\n\
            \ you can try casting the DateFormat you get from the factory methods\n\
            \ to a SimpleDateFormat. This will work for the majority\n of countries;\
            \ just remember to put it in a try block in case you\n encounter an unusual\
            \ one.\n\n You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with\n\
            \ ParsePosition and FieldPosition to\n allow you to\n progressively parse\
            \ through pieces of a string.\n align any particular field, or find out\
            \ where it is for selection\n on the screen.\n \n\n Synchronization\n\n\
            \ \n Date formats are not synchronized.\n It is recommended to create\
            \ separate format instances for each thread.\n If multiple threads access\
            \ a format concurrently, it must be synchronized\n externally."
