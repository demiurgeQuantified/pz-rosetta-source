          notes: "An engine that can transform a sequence of bytes in a specific charset\
            \ into a sequence of\n sixteen-bit Unicode characters.\n\n \n\n  The input\
            \ byte sequence is provided in a byte buffer or a series\n of such buffers.\
            \  The output character sequence is written to a character buffer\n or\
            \ a series of such buffers.  A decoder should always be used by making\n\
            \ the following sequence of method invocations, hereinafter referred to\
            \ as a\n decoding operation:\n\n \n\n    Reset the decoder via the reset\
            \ method, unless it\n   has not been used before; \n\n    Invoke the decode\
            \ method zero or more times, as\n   long as additional input may be available,\
            \ passing false for the\n   endOfInput argument and filling the input\
            \ buffer and flushing the\n   output buffer between invocations; \n\n\
            \    Invoke the decode method one final time, passing\n   true for the\
            \ endOfInput argument; and then \n\n    Invoke the flush method so that\
            \ the decoder can\n   flush any internal state to the output buffer. \n\
            \n \n\n Each invocation of the decode method will decode as many\n bytes\
            \ as possible from the input buffer, writing the resulting characters\n\
            \ to the output buffer.  The decode method returns when more\n input is\
            \ required, when there is not enough room in the output buffer, or\n when\
            \ a decoding error has occurred.  In each case a CoderResult\n object\
            \ is returned to describe the reason for termination.  An invoker can\n\
            \ examine this object and fill the input buffer, flush the output buffer,\
            \ or\n attempt to recover from a decoding error, as appropriate, and try\
            \ again.\n\n \n\n  There are two general types of decoding errors.  If\
            \ the input byte\n sequence is not legal for this charset then the input\
            \ is considered malformed.  If\n the input byte sequence is legal but\
            \ cannot be mapped to a valid\n Unicode character then an unmappable character\
            \ has been encountered.\n\n \n\n  How a decoding error is handled depends\
            \ upon the action requested for\n that type of error, which is described\
            \ by an instance of the CodingErrorAction class.  The possible error actions\
            \ are to ignore the erroneous input, report the error to the invoker via\n\
            \ the returned CoderResult object, or replace the erroneous input with\
            \ the current value of the\n replacement string.  The replacement\n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n has the initial value \"&#92;uFFFD\";\n\n\n its value may be\
            \ changed via the replaceWith method.\n\n  The default action for malformed-input\
            \ and unmappable-character errors\n is to report them.  The\n malformed-input\
            \ error action may be changed via the onMalformedInput method; the\n unmappable-character\
            \ action may be changed via the onUnmappableCharacter method.\n\n  This\
            \ class is designed to handle many of the details of the decoding\n process,\
            \ including the implementation of error actions.  A decoder for a\n specific\
            \ charset, which is a concrete subclass of this class, need only\n implement\
            \ the abstract decodeLoop method, which\n encapsulates the basic decoding\
            \ loop.  A subclass that maintains internal\n state should, additionally,\
            \ override the implFlush and\n implReset methods.\n\n  Instances of this\
            \ class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent\n threads."

              \ bytes from the input buffer and writing\n characters to the output\
