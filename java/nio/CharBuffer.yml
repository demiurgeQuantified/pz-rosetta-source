          notes: "A char buffer.\n\n  This class defines four categories of operations\
            \ upon\n char buffers:\n\n \n\n    Absolute and relative get and\n   put\
            \ methods that read and write\n   single chars; \n\n    Absolute and relative\
            \ bulk get\n   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of chars from\
            \ this buffer\n   into an array; and\n\n    Absolute and relative bulk\
            \ put\n   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of chars from a\n\
            \   char array{#if[char]?,&#32;a&#32;string,} or some other char\n   buffer\
            \ into this buffer;{#if[!byte]?&#32;and} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
            \    A method for compacting\n   a char buffer.  \n\n \n\n  Char buffers\
            \ can be created either by allocation, which allocates space for the buffer's\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n content, by wrapping an existing\n char array {#if[char]?or&#32;string}\
            \ into a buffer, or by creating a\n view of an existing byte buffer.\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

            \ Like a byte buffer, a char buffer is either direct or non-direct.  A\n\
            \ char buffer created via the wrap methods of this class will\n be non-direct.\
            \  A char buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will\n be direct if,\
            \ and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not\n a char\
            \ buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the isDirect method.\
            \  \n\n\n\n\n\n  This class implements the CharSequence interface so that\n\
            \ character buffers may be used wherever character sequences are accepted,\
            \ for\n example in the regular-expression package java.util.regex.\n The\
            \ methods defined by CharSequence operate relative to the current\n position\
            \ of the buffer when they are invoked.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Methods in\
            \ this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are\n specified\
            \ to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows\n method\
            \ invocations to be chained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The\
            \ sequence of statements\n\n \n cb.put(\"text/\");\n cb.put(subtype);\n\
            \ cb.put(\"; charset=\");\n cb.put(enc);\n\n can, for example, be replaced\
            \ by the single statement\n\n \n cb.put(\"text/\").put(subtype).put(\"\
            ; charset=\").put(enc);"
