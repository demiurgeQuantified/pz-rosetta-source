          notes: "Service-provider class for file systems. The methods defined by\
            \ the Files class will typically delegate to an instance of this\n class.\n\
            \n  A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class\
            \ that\n implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider\
            \ is\n identified by a URI scheme. The default provider\n is identified\
            \ by the URI scheme \"file\". It creates the FileSystem that\n provides\
            \ access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.\n\
            \ The FileSystems class defines how file system providers are located\n\
            \ and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider\
            \ but\n may be overridden if the system property java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider\
            \ is set. In that case, the\n provider has a one argument constructor\
            \ whose formal parameter type is \n FileSystemProvider. All other providers\
            \ have a zero argument constructor\n that initializes the provider.\n\n\
            \  A provider is a factory for one or more FileSystem instances. Each\n\
            \ file system is identified by a URI where the URI's scheme matches\n\
            \ the provider's scheme. The default file system, for example,\n is identified\
            \ by the URI \"file:///\". A memory-based file system,\n for example,\
            \ may be identified by a URI such as \"memory:///?name=logfs\".\n The\
            \ newFileSystem method may be used to create a file\n system, and the\
            \ getFileSystem method may be used to\n obtain a reference to an existing\
            \ file system created by the provider. Where\n a provider is the factory\
            \ for a single file system then it is provider dependent\n if the file\
            \ system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when\n\
            \ the newFileSystem method is invoked. In the case of the default\n provider,\
            \ the FileSystem is created when the provider is initialized.\n\n  All\
            \ of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent\n\
            \ threads."
