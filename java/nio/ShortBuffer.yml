          notes: "A short buffer.\n\n  This class defines four categories of operations\
            \ upon\n short buffers:\n\n \n\n    Absolute and relative get and\n  \
            \ put methods that read and write\n   single shorts; \n\n    Absolute\
            \ and relative bulk get\n   methods that transfer contiguous sequences\
            \ of shorts from this buffer\n   into an array; and\n\n    Absolute and\
            \ relative bulk put\n   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of\
            \ shorts from a\n   short array{#if[char]?,&#32;a&#32;string,} or some\
            \ other short\n   buffer into this buffer;{#if[!byte]?&#32;and} \n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    A method for compacting\n   a short buffer.\
            \  \n\n \n\n  Short buffers can be created either by allocation, which\
            \ allocates space for the buffer's\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n content, by wrapping\
            \ an existing\n short array {#if[char]?or&#32;string} into a buffer, or\
            \ by creating a\n view of an existing byte buffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

            \ a short buffer is either direct or non-direct.  A\n short buffer created\
            \ via the wrap methods of this class will\n be non-direct.  A short buffer\
            \ created as a view of a byte buffer will\n be direct if, and only if,\
            \ the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not\n a short buffer is\
            \ direct may be determined by invoking the isDirect method.  \n\n\n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Methods in this class that do not otherwise\
            \ have a value to return are\n specified to return the buffer upon which\
            \ they are invoked.  This allows\n method invocations to be chained."
