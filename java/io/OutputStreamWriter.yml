          notes: "An OutputStreamWriter is a bridge from character streams to byte\
            \ streams:\n Characters written to it are encoded into bytes using a specified\
            \ charset.  The charset that it uses\n may be specified by name or may\
            \ be given explicitly, or the platform's\n default charset may be accepted.\n\
            \n  Each invocation of a write() method causes the encoding converter\
            \ to be\n invoked on the given character(s).  The resulting bytes are\
            \ accumulated in a\n buffer before being written to the underlying output\
            \ stream.  Note that the\n characters passed to the write() methods are\
            \ not buffered.\n\n  For top efficiency, consider wrapping an OutputStreamWriter\
            \ within a\n BufferedWriter so as to avoid frequent converter invocations.\
            \  For example:\n\n \n Writer out\n   = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out));\n\
            \ \n\n  A surrogate pair is a character represented by a sequence of two\n\
            \ char values: A high surrogate in the range '&#92;uD800' to\n '&#92;uDBFF'\
            \ followed by a low surrogate in the range '&#92;uDC00' to\n '&#92;uDFFF'.\n\
            \n  A malformed surrogate element is a high surrogate that is not\n followed\
            \ by a low surrogate or a low surrogate that is not preceded by a\n high\
            \ surrogate.\n\n  This class always replaces malformed surrogate elements\
            \ and unmappable\n character sequences with the charset's default substitution\
            \ sequence.\n The CharsetEncoder class should be used when more\n control\
            \ over the encoding process is required."
