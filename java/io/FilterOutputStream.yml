          notes: "This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output\n\
            \ streams. These streams sit on top of an already existing output\n stream\
            \ (the underlying output stream) which it uses as its\n basic sink of\
            \ data, but possibly transforming the data along the\n way or providing\
            \ additional functionality.\n \n The class FilterOutputStream itself simply\
            \ overrides\n all methods of OutputStream with versions that pass\n all\
            \ requests to the underlying output stream. Subclasses of\n FilterOutputStream\
            \ may further override some of these\n methods as well as provide additional\
            \ methods and fields."
