          notes: "A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a\n\
            \ File or to a FileDescriptor. Whether or not\n a file is available or\
            \ may be created depends upon the underlying\n platform.  Some platforms,\
            \ in particular, allow a file to be opened\n for writing by only one FileOutputStream\
            \ (or other\n file-writing object) at a time.  In such situations the\
            \ constructors in\n this class will fail if the file involved is already\
            \ open.\n\n FileOutputStream is meant for writing streams of raw bytes\n\
            \ such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using\n\
            \ FileWriter."
