          notes: "A BufferedInputStream adds\n functionality to another input stream-namely,\n\
            \ the ability to buffer the input and to\n support the mark and reset\n\
            \ methods. When  the BufferedInputStream\n is created, an internal buffer\
            \ array is\n created. As bytes  from the stream are read\n or skipped,\
            \ the internal buffer is refilled\n as necessary  from the contained input\
            \ stream,\n many bytes at a time. The mark\n operation  remembers a point\
            \ in the input\n stream and the reset operation\n causes all the  bytes\
            \ read since the most\n recent mark operation to be\n reread before new\
            \ bytes are  taken from\n the contained input stream."
