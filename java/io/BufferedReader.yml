          notes: "Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so\
            \ as to\n provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and\
            \ lines.\n\n  The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may\
            \ be used.  The\n default is large enough for most purposes.\n\n  In general,\
            \ each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding\n read request\
            \ to be made of the underlying character or byte stream.  It is\n therefore\
            \ advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read()\n\
            \ operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders.\
            \  For\n example,\n\n \n BufferedReader in\n   = new BufferedReader(new\
            \ FileReader(\"foo.in\"));\n \n\n will buffer the input from the specified\
            \ file.  Without buffering, each\n invocation of read() or readLine()\
            \ could cause bytes to be read from the\n file, converted into characters,\
            \ and then returned, which can be very\n inefficient.\n\n  Programs that\
            \ use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by\n replacing\
            \ each DataInputStream with an appropriate BufferedReader."
