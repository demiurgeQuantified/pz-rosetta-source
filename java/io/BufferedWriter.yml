          notes: "Writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so\
            \ as to\n provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays,\
            \ and strings.\n\n  The buffer size may be specified, or the default size\
            \ may be accepted.\n The default is large enough for most purposes.\n\n\
            \  A newLine() method is provided, which uses the platform's own notion\
            \ of\n line separator as defined by the system property line.separator.\n\
            \ Not all platforms use the newline character ('\\n') to terminate lines.\n\
            \ Calling this method to terminate each output line is therefore preferred\
            \ to\n writing a newline character directly.\n\n  In general, a Writer\
            \ sends its output immediately to the underlying\n character or byte stream.\
            \  Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable\n to wrap a BufferedWriter\
            \ around any Writer whose write() operations may be\n costly, such as\
            \ FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.  For example,\n\n \n PrintWriter\
            \ out\n   = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"foo.out\"\
            )));\n \n\n will buffer the PrintWriter's output to the file.  Without\
            \ buffering, each\n invocation of a print() method would cause characters\
            \ to be converted into\n bytes that would then be written immediately\
            \ to the file, which can be very\n inefficient."
