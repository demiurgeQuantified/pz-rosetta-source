          notes: "A FilterInputStream contains\n some other input stream, which it\
            \ uses as\n its  basic source of data, possibly transforming\n the data\
            \ along the way or providing  additional\n functionality. The class FilterInputStream\n\
            \ itself simply overrides all  methods of\n InputStream with versions\
            \ that\n pass all requests to the contained  input\n stream. Subclasses\
            \ of FilterInputStream\n may further override some of  these methods\n\
            \ and may also provide additional methods\n and fields."
