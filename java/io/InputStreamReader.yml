          notes: "An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character\
            \ streams: It\n reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified\
            \ charset.  The charset that it uses\n may be specified by name or may\
            \ be given explicitly, or the platform's\n default charset may be accepted.\n\
            \n  Each invocation of one of an InputStreamReader's read() methods may\n\
            \ cause one or more bytes to be read from the underlying byte-input stream.\n\
            \ To enable the efficient conversion of bytes to characters, more bytes\
            \ may\n be read ahead from the underlying stream than are necessary to\
            \ satisfy the\n current read operation.\n\n  For top efficiency, consider\
            \ wrapping an InputStreamReader within a\n BufferedReader.  For example:\n\
            \n \n BufferedReader in\n   = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(anInputStream));"
