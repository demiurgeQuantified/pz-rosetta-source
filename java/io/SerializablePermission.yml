          notes: "This class is for Serializable permissions. A SerializablePermission\n\
            \ contains a name (also referred to as a \"target name\") but\n no actions\
            \ list; you either have the named permission\n or you don't.\n\n \n The\
            \ target name is the name of the Serializable permission (see below).\n\
            \n \n The following table lists the standard SerializablePermission target\
            \ names,\n and for each provides a description of what the permission\
            \ allows\n and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.\n\
            \n \n Permission target name, what the permission allows, and associated\
            \ risks\n \n \n Permission Target Name\n What the Permission Allows\n\
            \ Risks of Allowing this Permission\n \n \n \n\n \n   enableSubclassImplementation\n\
            \   Subclass implementation of ObjectOutputStream or ObjectInputStream\n\
            \ to override the default serialization or deserialization, respectively,\n\
            \ of objects\n   Code can use this to serialize or\n deserialize classes\
            \ in a purposefully malfeasant manner. For example,\n during serialization,\
            \ malicious code can use this to\n purposefully store confidential private\
            \ field data in a way easily accessible\n to attackers. Or, during deserialization\
            \ it could, for example, deserialize\n a class with all its private fields\
            \ zeroed out.\n \n\n \n   enableSubstitution\n   Substitution of one object\
            \ for another during\n serialization or deserialization\n   This is dangerous\
            \ because malicious code\n can replace the actual object with one which\
            \ has incorrect or\n malignant data.\n \n\n \n   serialFilter\n   Setting\
            \ a filter for ObjectInputStreams.\n   Code could remove a configured\
            \ filter and remove protections\n       already established."
