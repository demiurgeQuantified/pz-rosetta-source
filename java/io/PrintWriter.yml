          notes: "Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.\
            \  This\n class implements all of the print methods found in PrintStream.\
            \  It does not contain methods for writing raw bytes, for which\n a program\
            \ should use unencoded byte streams.\n\n  Unlike the PrintStream class,\
            \ if automatic flushing is enabled\n it will be done only when one of\
            \ the println, printf, or\n format methods is invoked, rather than whenever\
            \ a newline character\n happens to be output.  These methods use the platform's\
            \ own notion of line\n separator rather than the newline character.\n\n\
            \  Methods in this class never throw I/O exceptions, although some of\
            \ its\n constructors may.  The client may inquire as to whether any errors\
            \ have\n occurred by invoking checkError().\n\n  This class always replaces\
            \ malformed and unmappable character sequences with\n the charset's default\
            \ replacement string.\n The CharsetEncoder class should be used when more\n\
            \ control over the encoding process is required."
