          notes: TurboTuTone.  A pair of colors for global light interior and exterior,
            the alpha of the colors is blend intensity.  When outside the shader is
            used to apply global light, when inside a room its using a different method
            (using the weather mask) to do the coloring of outside parts.  This requires
            separate balancing of colors as using one and the same for both methods
            doesn't always look right.
