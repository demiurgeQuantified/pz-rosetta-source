          notes: "AccessibleContext represents the minimum information all accessible\n\
            \ objects return. This information includes the accessible name, description,\n\
            \ role, and state of the object, as well as information about its parent\
            \ and\n children. AccessibleContext also contains methods for obtaining\
            \ more\n specific accessibility information about a component. If the\
            \ component\n supports them, these methods will return an object that\
            \ implements one or\n more of the following interfaces:\n \n   AccessibleAction\
            \ - the object can perform one or more actions.\n   This interface provides\
            \ the standard mechanism for an assistive technology\n   to determine\
            \ what those actions are and tell the object to perform them.\n   Any\
            \ object that can be manipulated should support this interface.\n   AccessibleComponent\
            \ - the object has a graphical\n   representation. This interface provides\
            \ the standard mechanism for an\n   assistive technology to determine\
            \ and set the graphical representation of\n   the object. Any object that\
            \ is rendered on the screen should support this\n   interface.\n   AccessibleSelection\
            \ - the object allows its children to be\n   selected. This interface\
            \ provides the standard mechanism for an assistive\n   technology to determine\
            \ the currently selected children of the object as\n   well as modify\
            \ its selection set. Any object that has children that can be\n   selected\
            \ should support this interface.\n   AccessibleText - the object presents\
            \ editable textual\n   information on the display. This interface provides\
            \ the standard mechanism\n   for an assistive technology to access that\
            \ text via its content,\n   attributes, and spatial location. Any object\
            \ that contains editable text\n   should support this interface.\n   AccessibleValue\
            \ - the object supports a numerical value. This\n   interface provides\
            \ the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to\n   determine\
            \ and set the current value of the object, as well as obtain its\n   minimum\
            \ and maximum values. Any object that supports a numerical value\n   should\
            \ support this interface."
