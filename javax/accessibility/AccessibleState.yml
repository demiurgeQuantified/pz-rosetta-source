          notes: "Class AccessibleState describes a component's particular state.\
            \ The\n actual state of the component is defined as an AccessibleStateSet,\n\
            \ which is a composed set of AccessibleStates.\n \n The AccessibleBundle.toDisplayString()\
            \ method allows you to obtain the localized\n string for a locale independent\
            \ key from a predefined ResourceBundle\n for the keys defined in this\
            \ class.\n \n The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration\
            \ of common\n object roles. A public constructor for this class has been\
            \ purposely omitted\n and applications should use one of the constants\
            \ from this class. If the\n constants in this class are not sufficient\
            \ to describe the role of an object,\n a subclass should be generated\
            \ from this class and it should provide\n constants in a similar manner."
