          notes: "This class is used to create a multiple-exclusion scope for\n a\
            \ set of buttons. Creating a set of buttons with the\n same ButtonGroup\
            \ object means that\n turning \"on\" one of those buttons\n turns off\
            \ all other buttons in the group.\n \n A ButtonGroup can be used with\n\
            \ any set of objects that inherit from AbstractButton.\n Typically a button\
            \ group contains instances of\n JRadioButton,\n JRadioButtonMenuItem,\n\
            \ or JToggleButton.\n It wouldn't make sense to put an instance of\n JButton\
            \ or JMenuItem\n in a button group\n because JButton and JMenuItem\n don't\
            \ implement the selected state.\n \n Initially, all buttons in the group\
            \ are unselected.\n \n For examples and further information on using button\
            \ groups see\n How to Use Radio Buttons,\n a section in The Java Tutorial.\n\
            \ \n Warning:\n Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible\
            \ with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization support is\n\
            \ appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running\n\
            \ the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage\n\
            \ of all JavaBeans\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n Please\
            \ see XMLEncoder."
