          notes: "Popups are used to display a Component to the user, typically\n\
            \ on top of all the other Components in a particular containment\n hierarchy.\
            \ Popups have a very small life cycle. Once you\n have obtained a Popup,\
            \ and hidden it (invoked the\n hide method), you should no longer\n invoke\
            \ any methods on it. This allows the PopupFactory to cache\n Popups for\
            \ later use.\n \n The general contract is that if you need to change the\
            \ size of the\n Component, or location of the Popup, you should\n obtain\
            \ a new Popup.\n \n Popup does not descend from Component, rather\n implementations\
            \ of Popup are responsible for creating\n and maintaining their own Components\
            \ to render the\n requested Component to the user.\n \n You typically\
            \ do not explicitly create an instance of Popup,\n instead obtain one\
            \ from a PopupFactory."
