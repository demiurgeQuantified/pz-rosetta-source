          notes: "InputMap provides a binding between an input event (currently only\n\
            \ KeyStrokes are used) and an Object. InputMaps are\n usually used with\
            \ an ActionMap, to determine an Action to\n perform when a key is pressed.\
            \ An InputMap can have a parent that\n is searched for bindings not defined\
            \ in the InputMap.\n As with ActionMap if you create a cycle, eg:\n \n\
            \   InputMap am = new InputMap();\n   InputMap bm = new InputMap():\n\
            \   am.setParent(bm);\n   bm.setParent(am);\n \n some of the methods will\
            \ cause a StackOverflowError to be thrown."
