          notes: "This interface inherits from CharacterData and represents the\n\
            \ content of a comment, i.e., all the characters between the starting\n\
            \ '<!--' and ending '-->'. Note that this is\n the definition of a comment\
            \ in XML, and, in practice, HTML, although some\n HTML tools may implement\
            \ the full SGML comment structure.\n  No lexical check is done on the\
            \ content of a comment and it is\n therefore possible to have the character\
            \ sequence \"--\"\n (double-hyphen) in the content, which is illegal in\
            \ a comment per section\n 2.5 of [XML 1.0]. The\n presence of this character\
            \ sequence must generate a fatal error during\n serialization.\n See also\
            \ the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification."
