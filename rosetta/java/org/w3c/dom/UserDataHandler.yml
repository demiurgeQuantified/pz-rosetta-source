          notes: "When associating an object to a key on a node using\n Node.setUserData()\
            \ the application can provide a handler\n that gets called when the node\
            \ the object is associated to is being\n cloned, imported, or renamed.\
            \ This can be used by the application to\n implement various behaviors\
            \ regarding the data it associates to the DOM\n nodes. This interface\
            \ defines that handler.\n See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level\
