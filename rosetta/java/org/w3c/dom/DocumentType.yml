          notes: "Each Document has a doctype attribute whose value\n is either null\
            \ or a DocumentType object. The\n DocumentType interface in the DOM Core\
            \ provides an interface\n to the list of entities that are defined for\
            \ the document, and little\n else because the effect of namespaces and\
            \ the various XML schema efforts\n on DTD representation are not clearly\
            \ understood as of this writing.\n DOM Level 3 doesn't support editing\
            \ DocumentType nodes.\n DocumentType nodes are read-only.\n See also the\
            \ Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification."
