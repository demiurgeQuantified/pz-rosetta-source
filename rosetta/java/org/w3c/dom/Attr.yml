          notes: "The Attr interface represents an attribute in an\n Element object.\
            \ Typically the allowable values for the\n attribute are defined in a\
            \ schema associated with the document.\n Attr objects inherit the Node\
            \ interface, but\n since they are not actually child nodes of the element\
            \ they describe, the\n DOM does not consider them part of the document\
            \ tree. Thus, the\n Node attributes parentNode,\n previousSibling, and\
            \ nextSibling have a\n null value for Attr objects. The DOM takes the\n\
            \ view that attributes are properties of elements rather than having a\n\
            \ separate identity from the elements they are associated with; this should\n\
            \ make it more efficient to implement such features as default attributes\n\
            \ associated with all elements of a given type. Furthermore,\n Attr nodes\
            \ may not be immediate children of a\n DocumentFragment. However, they\
            \ can be associated with\n Element nodes contained within a\n DocumentFragment.\
            \ In short, users and implementors of the\n DOM need to be aware that\
            \ Attr nodes have some things in\n common with other objects inheriting\
            \ the Node interface, but\n they also are quite distinct.\n The attribute's\
            \ effective value is determined as follows: if this\n attribute has been\
            \ explicitly assigned any value, that value is the\n attribute's effective\
            \ value; otherwise, if there is a declaration for\n this attribute, and\
            \ that declaration includes a default value, then that\n default value\
            \ is the attribute's effective value; otherwise, the\n attribute does\
            \ not exist on this element in the structure model until it\n has been\
            \ explicitly added. Note that the Node.nodeValue\n attribute on the Attr\
            \ instance can also be used to retrieve\n the string version of the attribute's\
            \ value(s).\n  If the attribute was not explicitly given a value in the\
            \ instance\n document but has a default value provided by the schema associated\
            \ with\n the document, an attribute node will be created with\n specified\
            \ set to false. Removing attribute\n nodes for which a default value is\
            \ defined in the schema generates a new\n attribute node with the default\
            \ value and specified set to\n false. If validation occurred while invoking\n\
            \ Document.normalizeDocument(), attribute nodes with\n specified equals\
            \ to false are recomputed\n according to the default attribute values\
            \ provided by the schema. If no\n default value is associate with this\
            \ attribute in the schema, the\n attribute node is discarded.\n In XML,\
            \ where the value of an attribute can contain entity references,\n the\
            \ child nodes of the Attr node may be either\n Text or EntityReference\
            \ nodes (when these are\n in use; see the description of EntityReference\
            \ for\n discussion).\n The DOM Core represents all attribute values as\
            \ simple strings, even if\n the DTD or schema associated with the document\
            \ declares them of some\n specific type such as tokenized.\n The way attribute\
            \ value normalization is performed by the DOM\n implementation depends\
            \ on how much the implementation knows about the\n schema in use. Typically,\
            \ the value and\n nodeValue attributes of an Attr node initially\n returns\
            \ the normalized value given by the parser. It is also the case\n after\
            \ Document.normalizeDocument() is called (assuming the\n right options\
            \ have been set). But this may not be the case after\n mutation, independently\
            \ of whether the mutation is performed by setting\n the string value directly\
            \ or by changing the Attr child\n nodes. In particular, this is true when\
            \ character\n references are involved, given that they are not represented\
            \ in the DOM and they\n impact attribute value normalization. On the other\
            \ hand, if the\n implementation knows about the schema in use when the\
            \ attribute value is\n changed, and it is of a different type than CDATA,\
            \ it may normalize it\n again at that time. This is especially true of\
            \ specialized DOM\n implementations, such as SVG DOM implementations,\
            \ which store attribute\n values in an internal form different from a\
            \ string.\n The following table gives some examples of the relations between\
            \ the\n attribute value in the original document (parsed attribute), the\
            \ value as\n exposed in the DOM, and the serialization of the value:\n\
