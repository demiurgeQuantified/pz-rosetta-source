          notes: "EntityReference nodes may be used to represent an entity\n reference\
            \ in the tree. Note that character references and references to\n predefined\
            \ entities are considered to be expanded by the HTML or XML\n processor\
            \ so that characters are represented by their Unicode equivalent\n rather\
            \ than by an entity reference. Moreover, the XML processor may\n completely\
            \ expand references to entities while building the\n Document, instead\
            \ of providing EntityReference\n nodes. If it does provide such nodes,\
            \ then for an\n EntityReference node that represents a reference to a\
            \ known\n entity an Entity exists, and the subtree of the\n EntityReference\
            \ node is a copy of the Entity\n node subtree. However, the latter may\
            \ not be true when an entity contains\n an unbound namespace prefix. In\
            \ such a case, because the namespace prefix\n resolution depends on where\
            \ the entity reference is, the descendants of\n the EntityReference node\
            \ may be bound to different namespace\n URIs. When an EntityReference\
            \ node represents a reference to\n an unknown entity, the node has no\
            \ children and its replacement value,\n when used by Attr.value for example,\
            \ is empty.\n As for Entity nodes, EntityReference nodes and\n all their\
            \ descendants are readonly.\n Note: EntityReference nodes may cause element\n\
            \ content and attribute value normalization problems when, such as in\
            \ XML\n 1.0 and XML Schema, the normalization is performed after entity\
            \ reference\n are expanded.\n See also the Document Object Model (DOM)\
            \ Level 3 Core Specification."
