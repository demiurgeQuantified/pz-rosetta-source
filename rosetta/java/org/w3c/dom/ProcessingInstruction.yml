          notes: "The ProcessingInstruction interface represents a \"processing\n\
            \ instruction\", used in XML as a way to keep processor-specific information\n\
            \ in the text of the document.\n  No lexical check is done on the content\
            \ of a processing instruction and\n it is therefore possible to have the\
            \ character sequence\n \"?>\" in the content, which is illegal a processing\n\
            \ instruction per section 2.6 of [XML 1.0]. The\n presence of this character\
            \ sequence must generate a fatal error during\n serialization.\n See also\
            \ the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification."
