          notes: "The CharacterData interface extends Node with a set of\n attributes\
            \ and methods for accessing character data in the DOM. For\n clarity this\
            \ set is defined here rather than on each object that uses\n these attributes\
            \ and methods. No DOM objects correspond directly to\n CharacterData,\
            \ though Text and others do\n inherit the interface from it. All offsets\
            \ in this interface\n start from 0.\n As explained in the DOMString interface,\
            \ text strings in\n the DOM are represented in UTF-16, i.e. as a sequence\
            \ of 16-bit units. In\n the following, the term 16-bit units is used whenever\
            \ necessary to\n indicate that indexing on CharacterData is done in 16-bit\
            \ units.\n See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification."
