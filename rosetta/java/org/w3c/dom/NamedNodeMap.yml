          notes: "Objects implementing the NamedNodeMap interface are used to\n represent\
            \ collections of nodes that can be accessed by name. Note that\n NamedNodeMap\
            \ does not inherit from NodeList;\n NamedNodeMaps are not maintained in\
            \ any particular order.\n Objects contained in an object implementing\
            \ NamedNodeMap may\n also be accessed by an ordinal index, but this is\
            \ simply to allow\n convenient enumeration of the contents of a NamedNodeMap,\n\
            \ and does not imply that the DOM specifies an order to these Nodes.\n\
            \ NamedNodeMap objects in the DOM are live.\n See also the Document Object\
            \ Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification."
