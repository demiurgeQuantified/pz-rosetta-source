          notes: "The Node interface is the primary datatype for the entire\n Document\
            \ Object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree.\n While\
            \ all objects implementing the Node interface expose\n methods for dealing\
            \ with children, not all objects implementing the\n Node interface may\
            \ have children. For example,\n Text nodes may not have children, and\
            \ adding children to\n such nodes results in a DOMException being raised.\n\
            \ The attributes nodeName, nodeValue and\n attributes are included as\
            \ a mechanism to get at node\n information without casting down to the\
            \ specific derived interface. In\n cases where there is no obvious mapping\
            \ of these attributes for a\n specific nodeType (e.g., nodeValue for an\n\
            \ Element or attributes for a Comment\n ), this returns null. Note that\
            \ the specialized interfaces\n may contain additional and more convenient\
            \ mechanisms to get and set the\n relevant information.\n The values of\
            \ nodeName,\n nodeValue, and attributes vary according to the\n node type\
