          notes: "An ObjectInputStream deserializes primitive data and objects previously\n\
            \ written using an ObjectOutputStream.\n\n Warning: Deserialization of\
            \ untrusted data is inherently dangerous\n and should be avoided. Untrusted\
            \ data should be carefully validated according to the\n \"Serialization\
            \ and Deserialization\" section of the\n Secure Coding Guidelines for\
            \ Java SE.\n Serialization Filtering describes best\n practices for defensive\
            \ use of serial filters.\n \n\n The key to disabling deserialization attacks\
            \ is to prevent instances of\n arbitrary classes from being deserialized,\
            \ thereby preventing the direct or\n indirect execution of their methods.\n\
            \ ObjectInputFilter describes how to use filters and\n ObjectInputFilter.Config\
            \ describes how to configure the filter and filter factory.\n Each stream\
            \ has an optional deserialization filter\n to check the classes and resource\
            \ limits during deserialization.\n The JVM-wide filter factory ensures\
            \ that a filter can be set on every ObjectInputStream\n and every object\
            \ read from the stream can be checked.\n The ObjectInputStream constructors\
            \ invoke the filter factory\n to select the initial filter which may be\
            \ updated or replaced by setObjectInputFilter(java.io.ObjectInputFilter).\n\
            \ \n If an ObjectInputStream has a filter, the ObjectInputFilter can check\
            \ that\n the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream,\
            \ depth, and\n number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed\
            \ and\n if not, can terminate deserialization.\n\n ObjectOutputStream\
            \ and ObjectInputStream can provide an application with\n persistent storage\
            \ for graphs of objects when used with a FileOutputStream\n and FileInputStream\
            \ respectively.  ObjectInputStream is used to recover\n those objects\
            \ previously serialized. Other uses include passing objects\n between\
            \ hosts using a socket stream or for marshaling and unmarshaling\n arguments\
            \ and parameters in a remote communication system.\n\n ObjectInputStream\
            \ ensures that the types of all objects in the graph\n created from the\
            \ stream match the classes present in the Java Virtual\n Machine.  Classes\
            \ are loaded as required using the standard mechanisms.\n\n Only objects\
            \ that support the java.io.Serializable or\n java.io.Externalizable interface\
            \ can be read from streams.\n\n The method readObject is used to read\
            \ an object from the\n stream.  Java's safe casting should be used to\
            \ get the desired type.  In\n Java, strings and arrays are objects and\
            \ are treated as objects during\n serialization. When read they need to\
            \ be cast to the expected type.\n\n Primitive data types can be read from\
            \ the stream using the appropriate\n method on DataInput.\n\n The default\
            \ deserialization mechanism for objects restores the contents\n of each\
            \ field to the value and type it had when it was written.  Fields\n declared\
            \ as transient or static are ignored by the deserialization process.\n\
            \ References to other objects cause those objects to be read from the\
            \ stream\n as necessary.  Graphs of objects are restored correctly using\
            \ a reference\n sharing mechanism.  New objects are always allocated when\
            \ deserializing,\n which prevents existing objects from being overwritten.\n\
            \n Reading an object is analogous to running the constructors of a new\n\
            \ object.  Memory is allocated for the object and initialized to zero\
            \ (NULL).\n No-arg constructors are invoked for the non-serializable classes\
            \ and then\n the fields of the serializable classes are restored from\
            \ the stream starting\n with the serializable class closest to java.lang.object\
            \ and finishing with\n the object's most specific class.\n\n For example\
            \ to read from a stream as written by the example in\n ObjectOutputStream:\n\
            \ \n \n      FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"t.tmp\");\n \
            \     ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);\n\n      int\
            \ i = ois.readInt();\n      String today = (String) ois.readObject();\n\
            \      Date date = (Date) ois.readObject();\n\n      ois.close();\n \n\
            \n Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the\n\
            \ java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.\n\n Implementing\
            \ the Serializable interface allows object serialization to\n save and\
            \ restore the entire state of the object and it allows classes to\n evolve\
            \ between the time the stream is written and the time it is read.  It\n\
            \ automatically traverses references between objects, saving and restoring\n\
            \ entire graphs.\n\n Serializable classes that require special handling\
            \ during the\n serialization and deserialization process should implement\
            \ the following\n methods:\n\n \n private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream\
            \ stream)\n     throws IOException;\n private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream\
            \ stream)\n     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;\n private\
            \ void readObjectNoData()\n     throws ObjectStreamException;\n \n\n The\
            \ readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the state\n\
            \ of the object for its particular class using data written to the stream\
            \ by\n the corresponding writeObject method.  The method does not need\
            \ to concern\n itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or\
            \ subclasses.  State is\n restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream\
            \ for the individual\n fields and making assignments to the appropriate\
            \ fields of the object.\n Reading primitive data types is supported by\
            \ DataInput.\n\n Any attempt to read object data which exceeds the boundaries\
            \ of the\n custom data written by the corresponding writeObject method\
            \ will cause an\n OptionalDataException to be thrown with an eof field\
            \ value of true.\n Non-object reads which exceed the end of the allotted\
            \ data will reflect the\n end of data in the same way that they would\
            \ indicate the end of the stream:\n bytewise reads will return -1 as the\
            \ byte read or number of bytes read, and\n primitive reads will throw\
            \ EOFExceptions.  If there is no corresponding\n writeObject method, then\
            \ the end of default serialized data marks the end of\n the allotted data.\n\
            \n Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method\n\
            \ behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the\
            \ end of\n data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object\
            \ reads will\n throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise\
            \ reads will\n return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions.\
            \  Note that this\n behavior does not hold for streams written with the\
            \ old\n ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1 protocol, in which the\n\
            \ end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and\
            \ hence\n cannot be detected.\n\n The readObjectNoData method is responsible\
            \ for initializing the state of\n the object for its particular class\
            \ in the event that the serialization\n stream does not list the given\
            \ class as a superclass of the object being\n deserialized.  This may\
            \ occur in cases where the receiving party uses a\n different version\
            \ of the deserialized instance's class than the sending\n party, and the\
            \ receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by\n the sender's\
            \ version.  This may also occur if the serialization stream has\n been\
            \ tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing\n deserialized\
            \ objects properly despite a \"hostile\" or incomplete source\n stream.\n\
            \n Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object\n\
            \ that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface.  Subclasses\
            \ of\n Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this\
            \ case the\n non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to\
            \ allow its fields to\n be initialized.  In this case it is the responsibility\
            \ of the subclass to\n save and restore the state of the non-serializable\
            \ class. It is frequently\n the case that the fields of that class are\
            \ accessible (public, package, or\n protected) or that there are get and\
            \ set methods that can be used to restore\n the state.\n\n Any exception\
            \ that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by\n the ObjectInputStream\
            \ and abort the reading process.\n\n Implementing the Externalizable interface\
            \ allows the object to assume\n complete control over the contents and\
            \ format of the object's serialized\n form.  The methods of the Externalizable\
            \ interface, writeExternal and\n readExternal, are called to save and\
            \ restore the objects state.  When\n implemented by a class they can write\
            \ and read their own state using all of\n the methods of ObjectOutput\
            \ and ObjectInput.  It is the responsibility of\n the objects to handle\
            \ any versioning that occurs.\n\n Enum constants are deserialized differently\
            \ than ordinary serializable or\n externalizable objects.  The serialized\
            \ form of an enum constant consists\n solely of its name; field values\
            \ of the constant are not transmitted.  To\n deserialize an enum constant,\
            \ ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from\n the stream; the deserialized\
            \ constant is then obtained by calling the static\n method Enum.valueOf(Class,\
            \ String) with the enum constant's\n base type and the received constant\
            \ name as arguments.  Like other\n serializable or externalizable objects,\
            \ enum constants can function as the\n targets of back references appearing\
            \ subsequently in the serialization\n stream.  The process by which enum\
            \ constants are deserialized cannot be\n customized: any class-specific\
            \ readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve\n methods defined by enum\
            \ types are ignored during deserialization.\n Similarly, any serialPersistentFields\
            \ or serialVersionUID field declarations\n are also ignored--all enum\
            \ types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.\n\n \n Records are serialized\
            \ differently than ordinary serializable or externalizable\n objects.\
            \ During deserialization the record's canonical constructor is invoked\n\
            \ to construct the record object. Certain serialization-related methods,\
            \ such\n as readObject and writeObject, are ignored for serializable records.\
            \ See\n \n Java Object Serialization Specification, Section 1.13,\n \"\
            Serialization of Records\" for additional information."
