          notes: "The DataOutput interface provides\n for converting data from any\
            \ of the Java\n primitive types to a series of bytes and\n writing these\
            \ bytes to a binary stream.\n There is  also a facility for converting\n\
            \ a String into\n modified UTF-8\n format and writing the resulting series\n\
            \ of bytes.\n \n For all the methods in this interface that\n write bytes,\
            \ it is generally true that if\n a byte cannot be written for any reason,\n\
            \ an IOException is thrown."
