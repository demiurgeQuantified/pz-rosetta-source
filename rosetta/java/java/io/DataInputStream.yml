          notes: "A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data\n\
            \ types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent\n way.\
            \ An application uses a data output stream to write data that\n can later\
            \ be read by a data input stream.\n \n A DataInputStream is not safe for\
            \ use by multiple concurrent\n threads. If a DataInputStream is to be\
            \ used by more than one\n thread then access to the data input stream\
