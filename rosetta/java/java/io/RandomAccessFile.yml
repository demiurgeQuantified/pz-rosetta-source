          notes: "Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a\n\
            \ random access file. A random access file behaves like a large\n array\
            \ of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor,\n or\
            \ index into the implied array, called the file pointer;\n input operations\
            \ read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance\n the file pointer\
            \ past the bytes read. If the random access file is\n created in read/write\
            \ mode, then output operations are also available;\n output operations\
            \ write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance\n the file pointer\
            \ past the bytes written. Output operations that write\n past the current\
            \ end of the implied array cause the array to be\n extended. The file\
            \ pointer can be read by the\n getFilePointer method and set by the seek\n\
            \ method.\n \n It is generally true of all the reading routines in this\
            \ class that\n if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of\
            \ bytes has been\n read, an EOFException (which is a kind of\n IOException)\
            \ is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for\n any reason other than end-of-file,\
            \ an IOException other\n than EOFException is thrown. In particular, an\n\
            \ IOException may be thrown if the stream has been closed."

              \ synchronously to the underlying storage device.\n \n \n\n The \"rws\"\
              \ and \"rwd\" modes work much like the force(boolean) method of\n the\
              \ FileChannel class, passing arguments of\n true and false, respectively,\
              \ except that they always\n apply to every I/O operation and are therefore\
              \ often more efficient.  If\n the file resides on a local storage device\
              \ then when an invocation of a\n method of this class returns it is\
              \ guaranteed that all changes made to\n the file by that invocation\
              \ will have been written to that device.  This\n is useful for ensuring\
              \ that critical information is not lost in the\n event of a system crash.\
              \  If the file does not reside on a local device\n then no such guarantee\
              \ is made.\n\n The \"rwd\" mode can be used to reduce the number of\
              \ I/O\n operations performed.  Using \"rwd\" only requires updates to\
              \ the\n file's content to be written to storage; using \"rws\" requires\n\
              \ updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written,\
              \ which\n generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation.\n\
              \n If there is a security manager, its checkRead method is\n called\
              \ with the pathname of the file argument as its\n argument to see if\
              \ read access to the file is allowed.  If the mode\n allows writing,\
              \ the security manager's checkWrite method is\n also called with the\
              \ path argument to see if write access to the file is\n allowed."
