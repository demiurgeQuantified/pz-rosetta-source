          notes: "An ObjectOutputStream writes primitive data types and graphs of\
            \ Java objects\n to an OutputStream.  The objects can be read (reconstituted)\
            \ using an\n ObjectInputStream.  Persistent storage of objects can be\
            \ accomplished by\n using a file for the stream.  If the stream is a network\
            \ socket stream, the\n objects can be reconstituted on another host or\
            \ in another process.\n\n Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable\
            \ interface can be\n written to streams.  The class of each serializable\
            \ object is encoded\n including the class name and signature of the class,\
            \ the values of the\n object's fields and arrays, and the closure of any\
            \ other objects referenced\n from the initial objects.\n\n The method\
            \ writeObject is used to write an object to the stream.  Any\n object,\
            \ including Strings and arrays, is written with writeObject. Multiple\n\
            \ objects or primitives can be written to the stream.  The objects must\
            \ be\n read back from the corresponding ObjectInputstream with the same\
            \ types and\n in the same order as they were written.\n\n Primitive data\
            \ types can also be written to the stream using the\n appropriate methods\
            \ from DataOutput. Strings can also be written using the\n writeUTF method.\n\
            \n The default serialization mechanism for an object writes the class\
            \ of the\n object, the class signature, and the values of all non-transient\
            \ and\n non-static fields.  References to other objects (except in transient\
            \ or\n static fields) cause those objects to be written also. Multiple\
            \ references\n to a single object are encoded using a reference sharing\
            \ mechanism so that\n graphs of objects can be restored to the same shape\
            \ as when the original was\n written.\n\n For example to write an object\
            \ that can be read by the example in\n ObjectInputStream:\n \n \n    \
            \  FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"t.tmp\");\n      ObjectOutputStream\
            \ oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);\n\n      oos.writeInt(12345);\n \
            \     oos.writeObject(\"Today\");\n      oos.writeObject(new Date());\n\
            \n      oos.close();\n \n\n Classes that require special handling during\
            \ the serialization and\n deserialization process must implement special\
            \ methods with these exact\n signatures:\n \n \n private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream\
            \ stream)\n     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;\n private\
            \ void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)\n     throws IOException\n\
            \ private void readObjectNoData()\n     throws ObjectStreamException;\n\
            \ \n\n The writeObject method is responsible for writing the state of\
            \ the object\n for its particular class so that the corresponding readObject\
            \ method can\n restore it.  The method does not need to concern itself\
            \ with the state\n belonging to the object's superclasses or subclasses.\
            \  State is saved by\n writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream\
            \ using the\n writeObject method or by using the methods for primitive\
            \ data types\n supported by DataOutput.\n\n Serialization does not write\
            \ out the fields of any object that does not\n implement the java.io.Serializable\
            \ interface.  Subclasses of Objects that\n are not serializable can be\
            \ serializable. In this case the non-serializable\n class must have a\
            \ no-arg constructor to allow its fields to be initialized.\n In this\
            \ case it is the responsibility of the subclass to save and restore\n\
            \ the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently the case that\
            \ the\n fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or protected)\
            \ or that\n there are get and set methods that can be used to restore\
            \ the state.\n\n Serialization of an object can be prevented by implementing\
            \ writeObject\n and readObject methods that throw the NotSerializableException.\
            \  The\n exception will be caught by the ObjectOutputStream and abort\
            \ the\n serialization process.\n\n Implementing the Externalizable interface\
            \ allows the object to assume\n complete control over the contents and\
            \ format of the object's serialized\n form.  The methods of the Externalizable\
            \ interface, writeExternal and\n readExternal, are called to save and\
            \ restore the objects state.  When\n implemented by a class they can write\
            \ and read their own state using all of\n the methods of ObjectOutput\
            \ and ObjectInput.  It is the responsibility of\n the objects to handle\
            \ any versioning that occurs.\n\n Enum constants are serialized differently\
            \ than ordinary serializable or\n externalizable objects.  The serialized\
            \ form of an enum constant consists\n solely of its name; field values\
            \ of the constant are not transmitted.  To\n serialize an enum constant,\
            \ ObjectOutputStream writes the string returned by\n the constant's name\
            \ method.  Like other serializable or externalizable\n objects, enum constants\
            \ can function as the targets of back references\n appearing subsequently\
            \ in the serialization stream.  The process by which\n enum constants\
            \ are serialized cannot be customized; any class-specific\n writeObject\
            \ and writeReplace methods defined by enum types are ignored\n during\
            \ serialization.  Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or\n serialVersionUID\
            \ field declarations are also ignored--all enum types have a\n fixed serialVersionUID\
            \ of 0L.\n\n Primitive data, excluding serializable fields and externalizable\
            \ data, is\n written to the ObjectOutputStream in block-data records.\
            \ A block data record\n is composed of a header and data. The block data\
            \ header consists of a marker\n and the number of bytes to follow the\
            \ header.  Consecutive primitive data\n writes are merged into one block-data\
            \ record.  The blocking factor used for\n a block-data record will be\
            \ 1024 bytes.  Each block-data record will be\n filled up to 1024 bytes,\
            \ or be written whenever there is a termination of\n block-data mode.\
            \  Calls to the ObjectOutputStream methods writeObject,\n defaultWriteObject\
            \ and writeFields initially terminate any existing\n block-data record.\n\
            \n Records are serialized differently than ordinary serializable or externalizable\n\
            \ objects, see record serialization."

              \ objects is disabled until enableReplaceObject is called. The\n enableReplaceObject\
              \ method checks that the stream requesting to do\n replacement can be\
              \ trusted.  The first occurrence of each object written\n into the serialization\
              \ stream is passed to replaceObject.  Subsequent\n references to the\
              \ object are replaced by the object returned by the\n original call\
              \ to replaceObject.  To ensure that the private state of\n objects is\
              \ not unintentionally exposed, only trusted streams may use\n replaceObject.\n\
              \n The ObjectOutputStream.writeObject method takes a parameter of type\n\
              \ Object (as opposed to type Serializable) to allow for cases where\n\
              \ non-serializable objects are replaced by serializable ones.\n\n When\
              \ a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that either a\n complementary\
              \ substitution must be made during deserialization or that\n the substituted\
              \ object is compatible with every field where the\n reference will be\
              \ stored.  Objects whose type is not a subclass of the\n type of the\
              \ field or array element abort the serialization by raising an\n exception\
              \ and the object is not be stored.\n\n This method is called only once\
              \ when each object is first\n encountered.  All subsequent references\
              \ to the object will be redirected\n to the new object. This method\
              \ should return the object to be\n substituted or the original object.\n\
              \n Null can be returned as the object to be substituted, but may cause\n\
              \ NullReferenceException in classes that contain references to the\n\

              \ to a back-reference\n pointing to a previously serialized instance).\
              \  Specifically:\n \n   An object written via writeUnshared is always\
              \ serialized in the\n       same manner as a newly appearing object\
              \ (an object that has not\n       been written to the stream yet), regardless\
              \ of whether or not the\n       object has been written previously.\n\
              \n   If writeObject is used to write an object that has been previously\n\
              \       written with writeUnshared, the previous writeUnshared operation\n\
              \       is treated as if it were a write of a separate object.  In other\n\

              \ to\n       object data written by calls to writeUnshared.\n \n While\
              \ writing an object via writeUnshared does not in itself guarantee a\n\
              \ unique reference to the object when it is deserialized, it allows\
              \ a\n single object to be defined multiple times in a stream, so that\
