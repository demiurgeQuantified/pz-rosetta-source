          notes: "This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing\n\
            \ an output stream of bytes. An output stream accepts output bytes\n and\
            \ sends them to some sink.\n \n Applications that need to define a subclass\
            \ of\n OutputStream must always provide at least a method\n that writes\
            \ one byte of output."

              \ by\n the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing\
              \ the\n stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the\
