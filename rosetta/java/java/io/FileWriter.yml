          notes: "Writes text to character files using a default buffer size. Encoding\
            \ from characters\n to bytes uses either a specified charset\n or the\
            \ platform's\n default charset.\n\n \n Whether or not a file is available\
            \ or may be created depends upon the\n underlying platform.  Some platforms,\
            \ in particular, allow a file to be\n opened for writing by only one FileWriter\
            \ (or other file-writing\n object) at a time.  In such situations the\
            \ constructors in this class\n will fail if the file involved is already\
            \ open.\n\n \n The FileWriter is meant for writing streams of characters.\
            \ For writing\n streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileOutputStream."
