            \ The close method is invoked to release resources that the object is\n\
            \ holding (such as open files)."

            notes: "Closes this stream and releases any system resources associated\n\
              \ with it. If the stream is already closed then invoking this\n method\
              \ has no effect.\n\n  As noted in AutoCloseable.close(), cases where\
              \ the\n close may fail require careful attention. It is strongly advised\n\
              \ to relinquish the underlying resources and to internally\n mark the\
              \ Closeable as closed, prior to throwing\n the IOException."
