          notes: "A PrintStream adds functionality to another output stream,\n namely\
            \ the ability to print representations of various data values\n conveniently.\
            \  Two other features are provided as well.  Unlike other output\n streams,\
            \ a PrintStream never throws an\n IOException; instead, exceptional situations\
            \ merely set an\n internal flag that can be tested via the checkError\
            \ method.\n Optionally, a PrintStream can be created so as to flush\n\
            \ automatically; this means that the flush method of the underlying\n\
            \ output stream is automatically invoked after a byte array is written,\
            \ one\n of the println methods is invoked, or a newline character or byte\n\
            \ ('\\n') is written.\n\n  All characters printed by a PrintStream are\
            \ converted into\n bytes using the given encoding or charset, or the platform's\
            \ default\n character encoding if not specified.\n The PrintWriter class\
            \ should be used in situations that require\n writing characters rather\
            \ than bytes.\n\n  This class always replaces malformed and unmappable\
            \ character sequences\n with the charset's default replacement string.\n\
            \ The CharsetEncoder class should be used when more\n control over the\
            \ encoding process is required."
