          notes: "An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.\n\n\
            \  User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent pathname\n\
            \ strings to name files and directories.  This class presents an\n abstract,\
            \ system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames.  An\n abstract pathname\
            \ has two components:\n\n \n  An optional system-dependent prefix string,\n\
            \      such as a disk-drive specifier, \"/\" for the UNIX root\n     \
            \ directory, or \"\\\\\\\\\" for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and\n\
            \  A sequence of zero or more string names.\n \n\n The first name in an\
            \ abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the\n case of Microsoft\
            \ Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname.  Each subsequent name\n in an abstract\
            \ pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote\n either a directory\
            \ or a file.  The empty abstract pathname has no\n prefix and an empty\
            \ name sequence.\n\n  The conversion of a pathname string to or from an\
            \ abstract pathname is\n inherently system-dependent.  When an abstract\
            \ pathname is converted into a\n pathname string, each name is separated\
            \ from the next by a single copy of\n the default separator character.\
            \  The default name-separator\n character is defined by the system property\
            \ file.separator, and\n is made available in the public static fields\
            \ separator and separatorChar of this class.\n When a pathname string\
            \ is converted into an abstract pathname, the names\n within it may be\
            \ separated by the default name-separator character or by any\n other\
            \ name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.\n\
            \n  A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either\n absolute\
            \ or relative.  An absolute pathname is complete in\n that no other information\
            \ is required in order to locate the file that it\n denotes.  A relative\
            \ pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of\n information\
            \ taken from some other pathname.  By default the classes in the\n java.io\
            \ package always resolve relative pathnames against the\n current user\
            \ directory.  This directory is named by the system property\n user.dir,\
            \ and is typically the directory in which the Java\n virtual machine was\
            \ invoked.\n\n  The parent of an abstract pathname may be obtained by\
            \ invoking\n the getParent() method of this class and consists of the\
            \ pathname's\n prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except\
            \ for the last.\n Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of\
            \ any File\n object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with\
            \ the directory's\n absolute pathname.  For example, the directory denoted\
            \ by the abstract\n pathname \"/usr\" is an ancestor of the directory\
            \ denoted by the\n pathname \"/usr/local/bin\".\n\n  The prefix concept\
            \ is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms,\n and drive specifiers,\
            \ root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms,\n\
            \ as follows:\n\n \n\n  For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute\
            \ pathname is always\n \"/\".  Relative pathnames have no prefix.  The\
            \ abstract pathname\n denoting the root directory has the prefix \"/\"\
            \ and an empty\n name sequence.\n\n  For Microsoft Windows platforms,\
            \ the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive\n specifier consists\
            \ of the drive letter followed by \":\" and\n possibly followed by \"\\\
            \\\" if the pathname is absolute.  The\n prefix of a UNC pathname is \"\
            \\\\\\\\\"; the hostname and the share\n name are the first two names\
            \ in the name sequence.  A relative pathname that\n does not specify a\
            \ drive has no prefix.\n\n \n\n  Instances of this class may or may not\
            \ denote an actual file-system\n object such as a file or a directory.\
            \  If it does denote such an object\n then that object resides in a partition.\
            \  A partition is an\n operating system-specific portion of storage for\
            \ a file system.  A single\n storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive,\
            \ flash memory, CD-ROM) may\n contain multiple partitions.  The object,\
            \ if any, will reside on the\n partition named by some ancestor of the\
            \ absolute\n form of this pathname.\n\n  A file system may implement restrictions\
            \ to certain operations on the\n actual file-system object, such as reading,\
            \ writing, and executing.  These\n restrictions are collectively known\
            \ as access permissions.  The file\n system may have multiple sets of\
            \ access permissions on a single object.\n For example, one set may apply\
            \ to the object's owner, and another\n may apply to all other users. \
            \ The access permissions on an object may\n cause some methods in this\
            \ class to fail.\n\n  Instances of the File class are immutable; that\
            \ is, once\n created, the abstract pathname represented by a File object\n\
            \ will never change.\n\n Interoperability with java.nio.file package\n\
            \n  The java.nio.file\n package defines interfaces and classes for the\
            \ Java virtual machine to access\n files, file attributes, and file systems.\
            \ This API may be used to overcome\n many of the limitations of the java.io.File\
            \ class.\n The toPath method may be used to obtain a Path that uses the\
            \ abstract path represented by a File object to\n locate a file. The resulting\
            \ Path may be used with the Files class to provide more efficient and\
            \ extensive access to\n additional file operations, file attributes, and\
            \ I/O exceptions to help\n diagnose errors when an operation on a file\
            \ fails."
