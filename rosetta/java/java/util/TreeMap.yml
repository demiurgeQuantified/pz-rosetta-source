          notes: "A Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation.\n The map is\
            \ sorted according to the natural\n ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator\
            \ provided at map\n creation time, depending on which constructor is used.\n\
            \n This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the\n\
            \ containsKey, get, put and remove\n operations.  Algorithms are adaptations\
            \ of those in Cormen, Leiserson, and\n Rivest's Introduction to Algorithms.\n\
            \n Note that the ordering maintained by a tree map, like any sorted map,\
            \ and\n whether or not an explicit comparator is provided, must be consistent\n\
            \ with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the\n Map interface.\
            \  (See Comparable or Comparator for a\n precise definition of consistent\
            \ with equals.)  This is so because\n the Map interface is defined in\
            \ terms of the equals\n operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons\
            \ using its \n compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are deemed\
            \ equal by\n this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map, equal.\
            \  The behavior\n of a sorted map is well-defined even if its ordering\
            \ is\n inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract\n\
            \ of the Map interface.\n\n Note that this implementation is not synchronized.\n\
            \ If multiple threads access a map concurrently, and at least one of the\n\
            \ threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized\n externally.\
            \  (A structural modification is any operation that adds or\n deletes\
            \ one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated\n with an\
            \ existing key is not a structural modification.)  This is\n typically\
            \ accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally\n encapsulates\
            \ the map.\n If no such object exists, the map should be \"wrapped\" using\
            \ the\n Collections.synchronizedSortedMap\n method.  This is best done\
            \ at creation time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized access to the\
            \ map: \n   SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap(...));\n\
            \n The iterators returned by the iterator method of the collections\n\
            \ returned by all of this class's \"collection view methods\" are\n fail-fast:\
            \ if the map is structurally modified at any time after\n the iterator\
            \ is created, in any way except through the iterator's own\n remove method,\
            \ the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.  Thus, in\
            \ the face of concurrent\n modification, the iterator fails quickly and\
            \ cleanly, rather than risking\n arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior\
            \ at an undetermined time in the future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast behavior\
            \ of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking,\
            \ impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized\
            \ concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException\
            \ on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program\
            \ that depended on this\n exception for its correctness:   the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n All\
            \ Map.Entry pairs returned by methods in this class\n and its views represent\
            \ snapshots of mappings at the time they were\n produced. They do not\
            \ support the Entry.setValue\n method. (Note however that it is possible\
            \ to change mappings in the\n associated map using put.)\n\n This class\
            \ is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
