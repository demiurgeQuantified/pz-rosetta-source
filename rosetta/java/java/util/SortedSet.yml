          notes: "A Set that further provides a total ordering on its elements.\n\
            \ The elements are ordered using their natural\n ordering, or by a Comparator\
            \ typically provided at sorted\n set creation time.  The set's iterator\
            \ will traverse the set in\n ascending element order. Several additional\
            \ operations are provided\n to take advantage of the ordering.  (This\
            \ interface is the set\n analogue of SortedMap.)\n\n All elements inserted\
            \ into a sorted set must implement the Comparable\n interface (or be accepted\
            \ by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all\n such elements must\
            \ be mutually comparable: e1.compareTo(e2)\n (or comparator.compare(e1,\
            \ e2)) must not throw a\n ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2\
            \ in\n the sorted set.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause\
            \ the\n offending method or constructor invocation to throw a\n ClassCastException.\n\
            \n Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an\n\
            \ explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if\n\
            \ the sorted set is to correctly implement the Set interface.  (See\n\
            \ the Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a\n precise definition\
            \ of consistent with equals.)  This is so because\n the Set interface\
            \ is defined in terms of the equals\n operation, but a sorted set performs\
            \ all element comparisons using its\n compareTo (or compare) method, so\
            \ two elements that are\n deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint\
            \ of the sorted set,\n equal.  The behavior of a sorted set is well-defined\
            \ even if its\n ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to\
            \ obey the general\n contract of the Set interface.\n\n All general-purpose\
            \ sorted set implementation classes should\n provide four \"standard\"\
            \ constructors: 1) A void (no arguments)\n constructor, which creates\
            \ an empty sorted set sorted according to\n the natural ordering of its\
            \ elements.  2) A constructor with a\n single argument of type Comparator,\
            \ which creates an empty\n sorted set sorted according to the specified\
            \ comparator.  3) A\n constructor with a single argument of type Collection,\n\
            \ which creates a new sorted set with the same elements as its\n argument,\
            \ sorted according to the natural ordering of the elements.\n 4) A constructor\
            \ with a single argument of type SortedSet,\n which creates a new sorted\
            \ set with the same elements and the same\n ordering as the input sorted\
            \ set.  There is no way to enforce this\n recommendation, as interfaces\
            \ cannot contain constructors.\n\n Note: several methods return subsets\
            \ with restricted ranges.\n Such ranges are half-open, that is, they include\
            \ their low\n endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).\n\
            \ If you need a closed range (which includes both endpoints), and\n the\
            \ element type allows for calculation of the successor of a given\n value,\
            \ merely request the subrange from lowEndpoint to\n successor(highEndpoint).\
            \  For example, suppose that s\n is a sorted set of strings.  The following\
            \ idiom obtains a view\n containing all of the strings in s from low to\n\
            \ high, inclusive:\n   SortedSet<String> sub = s.subSet(low, high+\"\\\
            0\");\n\n A similar technique can be used to generate an open range (which\n\
            \ contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a view\n containing\
            \ all of the Strings in s from low to\n high, exclusive:\n   SortedSet<String>\
            \ sub = s.subSet(low+\"\\0\", high);\n\n This interface is a member of\
            \ the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
