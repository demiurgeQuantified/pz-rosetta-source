          notes: "A SortedSet extended with navigation methods reporting\n closest\
            \ matches for given search targets. Methods lower(E),\n floor(E), ceiling(E),\
            \ and higher(E) return elements\n respectively less than, less than or\
            \ equal, greater than or equal,\n and greater than a given element, returning\
            \ null if there\n is no such element.\n\n A NavigableSet may be accessed\
            \ and traversed in either\n ascending or descending order.  The descendingSet()\
            \ method\n returns a view of the set with the senses of all relational\
            \ and\n directional methods inverted. The performance of ascending\n operations\
            \ and views is likely to be faster than that of descending\n ones.  This\
            \ interface additionally defines methods pollFirst() and pollLast() that\
            \ return and remove the lowest\n and highest element, if one exists, else\
            \ returning null.\n Methods\n subSet(E, boolean, E, boolean),\n headSet(E,\
            \ boolean), and\n tailSet(E, boolean)\n differ from the like-named SortedSet\
            \ methods in accepting\n additional arguments describing whether lower\
            \ and upper bounds are\n inclusive versus exclusive.  Subsets of any NavigableSet\n\
            \ must implement the NavigableSet interface.\n\n The return values of\
            \ navigation methods may be ambiguous in\n implementations that permit\
            \ null elements. However, even\n in this case the result can be disambiguated\
            \ by checking\n contains(null). To avoid such issues, implementations\
            \ of\n this interface are encouraged to not permit insertion of\n null\
            \ elements. (Note that sorted sets of Comparable elements intrinsically\
            \ do not permit null.)\n\n Methods\n subSet(E, E),\n headSet(E), and\n\
            \ tailSet(E)\n are specified to return SortedSet to allow existing\n implementations\
            \ of SortedSet to be compatibly retrofitted to\n implement NavigableSet,\
            \ but extensions and implementations\n of this interface are encouraged\
            \ to override these methods to return\n NavigableSet.\n\n This interface\
            \ is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
