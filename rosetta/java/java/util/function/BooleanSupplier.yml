          notes: "Represents a supplier of boolean-valued results.  This is the\n\
            \ boolean-producing primitive specialization of Supplier.\n\n There is\
            \ no requirement that a new or distinct result be returned each\n time\
            \ the supplier is invoked.\n\n This is a functional interface\n whose\
            \ functional method is getAsBoolean()."
