          notes: "Represents an operation that accepts an object-valued and a\n long-valued\
            \ argument, and returns no result.  This is the\n (reference, long) specialization\
            \ of BiConsumer.\n Unlike most other functional interfaces, ObjLongConsumer\
            \ is\n expected to operate via side-effects.\n\n This is a functional\
            \ interface\n whose functional method is accept(Object, long)."
