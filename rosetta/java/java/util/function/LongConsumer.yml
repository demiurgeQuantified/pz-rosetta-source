          notes: "Represents an operation that accepts a single long-valued argument\
            \ and\n returns no result.  This is the primitive type specialization\
            \ of\n Consumer for long.  Unlike most other functional interfaces,\n\
            \ LongConsumer is expected to operate via side-effects.\n\n This is a\
            \ functional interface\n whose functional method is accept(long)."
