          notes: "Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns\
            \ no\n result.  This is the two-arity specialization of Consumer.\n Unlike\
            \ most other functional interfaces, BiConsumer is expected\n to operate\
            \ via side-effects.\n\n This is a functional interface\n whose functional\
            \ method is accept(Object, Object)."
