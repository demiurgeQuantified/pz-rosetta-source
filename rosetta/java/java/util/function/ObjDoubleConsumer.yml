          notes: "Represents an operation that accepts an object-valued and a\n double-valued\
            \ argument, and returns no result.  This is the\n (reference, double)\
            \ specialization of BiConsumer.\n Unlike most other functional interfaces,\
            \ ObjDoubleConsumer is\n expected to operate via side-effects.\n\n This\
            \ is a functional interface\n whose functional method is accept(Object,\
            \ double)."
