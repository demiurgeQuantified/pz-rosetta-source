          notes: "Provides default implementations of ExecutorService\n execution\
            \ methods. This class implements the submit,\n invokeAny and invokeAll\
            \ methods using a\n RunnableFuture returned by newTaskFor, which defaults\n\
            \ to the FutureTask class provided in this package.  For example,\n the\
            \ implementation of submit(Runnable) creates an\n associated RunnableFuture\
            \ that is executed and\n returned. Subclasses may override the newTaskFor\
            \ methods\n to return RunnableFuture implementations other than\n FutureTask.\n\
            \n Extension example. Here is a sketch of a class\n that customizes ThreadPoolExecutor\
            \ to use\n a CustomTask class instead of the default FutureTask:\n  <code>\n\
            \ public class CustomThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {\n\
            \n   static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableFuture<V> { ... }\n\
            \n   protected <V> RunnableFuture<V> newTaskFor(Callable<V> c) {\n   \
            \    return new CustomTask<V>(c);\n   }\n   protected <V> RunnableFuture<V>\
            \ newTaskFor(Runnable r, V v) {\n       return new CustomTask<V>(r, v);\n\
            \   }\n   // ... add constructors, etc.\n }</code>"
