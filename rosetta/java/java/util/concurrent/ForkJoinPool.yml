          notes: "An ExecutorService for running ForkJoinTasks.\n A ForkJoinPool provides\
            \ the entry point for submissions\n from non-ForkJoinTask clients, as\
            \ well as management and\n monitoring operations.\n\n A ForkJoinPool differs\
            \ from other kinds of ExecutorService mainly by virtue of employing\n\
            \ work-stealing: all threads in the pool attempt to find and\n execute\
            \ tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active\n tasks (eventually\
            \ blocking waiting for work if none exist). This\n enables efficient processing\
            \ when most tasks spawn other subtasks\n (as do most ForkJoinTasks), as\
            \ well as when many small\n tasks are submitted to the pool from external\
            \ clients.  Especially\n when setting asyncMode to true in constructors,\
            \ \n ForkJoinPools may also be appropriate for use with event-style\n\
            \ tasks that are never joined. All worker threads are initialized\n with\
            \ Thread.isDaemon() set true.\n\n A static commonPool() is available and\
            \ appropriate for\n most applications. The common pool is used by any\
            \ ForkJoinTask that\n is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool.\
            \ Using the common\n pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads\
            \ are slowly\n reclaimed during periods of non-use, and reinstated upon\
            \ subsequent\n use).\n\n For applications that require separate or custom\
            \ pools, a \n ForkJoinPool may be constructed with a given target parallelism\n\
            \ level; by default, equal to the number of available processors.\n The\
            \ pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available) threads\n by\
            \ dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker\n threads,\
            \ even if some tasks are stalled waiting to join others.\n However, no\
            \ such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of blocked\n I/O or other\
            \ unmanaged synchronization. The nested ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker interface\
            \ enables extension of the kinds of\n synchronization accommodated. The\
            \ default policies may be\n overridden using a constructor with parameters\
            \ corresponding to\n those documented in class ThreadPoolExecutor.\n\n\
            \ In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this\n class\
            \ provides status check methods (for example\n getStealCount()) that are\
            \ intended to aid in developing,\n tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications.\
            \ Also, method\n toString() returns indications of pool state in a\n convenient\
            \ form for informal monitoring.\n\n As is the case with other ExecutorServices,\
            \ there are three\n main task execution methods summarized in the following\
            \ table.\n These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already\n\
            \ engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main\n forms\
            \ of these methods accept instances of ForkJoinTask,\n but overloaded\
            \ forms also allow mixed execution of plain \n Runnable- or Callable-\
            \ based activities as well.  However,\n tasks that are already executing\
            \ in a pool should normally instead\n use the within-computation forms\
            \ listed in the table unless using\n async event-style tasks that are\
            \ not usually joined, in which case\n there is little difference among\
            \ choice of methods.\n\n \n Summary of task execution methods\n  \n  \
            \  \n     Call from non-fork/join clients\n     Call from within fork/join\
            \ computations\n  \n  \n     Arrange async execution\n     execute(ForkJoinTask)\n\
            \     ForkJoinTask.fork()\n  \n  \n     Await and obtain result\n    \
            \ invoke(ForkJoinTask)\n     ForkJoinTask.invoke()\n  \n  \n     Arrange\
            \ exec and obtain Future\n     submit(ForkJoinTask)\n     ForkJoinTask.fork()\
            \ (ForkJoinTasks are Futures)\n  \n \n\n The parameters used to construct\
            \ the common pool may be controlled by\n setting the following system\
            \ properties:\n \n java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism\n\
            \ - the parallelism level, a non-negative integer\n java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.threadFactory\n\
            \ - the class name of a ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory.\n The\
            \ system class loader\n is used to load this class.\n java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.exceptionHandler\n\
            \ - the class name of a Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.\n The system\
            \ class loader\n is used to load this class.\n java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.maximumSpares\n\
            \ - the maximum number of allowed extra threads to maintain target\n parallelism\
            \ (default 256).\n \n If no thread factory is supplied via a system property,\
            \ then the\n common pool uses a factory that uses the system class loader\
            \ as the\n thread context class loader.\n In addition, if a SecurityManager\
            \ is present, then\n the common pool uses a factory supplying threads\
            \ that have no\n Permissions enabled.\n\n Upon any error in establishing\
            \ these settings, default parameters\n are used. It is possible to disable\
            \ or limit the use of threads in\n the common pool by setting the parallelism\
            \ property to zero, and/or\n using a factory that may return null. However\
            \ doing so may\n cause unjoined tasks to never be executed.\n\n Implementation\
            \ notes: This implementation restricts the\n maximum number of running\
            \ threads to 32767. Attempts to create\n pools with greater than the maximum\
            \ number result in\n IllegalArgumentException.\n\n This implementation\
            \ rejects submitted tasks (that is, by throwing\n RejectedExecutionException)\
            \ only when the pool is shut down\n or internal resources have been exhausted."
