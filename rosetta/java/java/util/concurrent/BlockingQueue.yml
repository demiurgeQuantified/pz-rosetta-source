          notes: "A Queue that additionally supports operations that wait for\n the\
            \ queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait\n for\
            \ space to become available in the queue when storing an element.\n\n\
            \ BlockingQueue methods come in four forms, with different ways\n of handling\
            \ operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be\n satisfied\
            \ at some point in the future:\n one throws an exception, the second returns\
            \ a special value (either\n null or false, depending on the operation),\
            \ the third\n blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation\
            \ can succeed,\n and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit\
            \ before giving\n up.  These methods are summarized in the following table:\n\
            \n \n Summary of BlockingQueue methods\n  \n    \n    Throws exception\n\
            \    Special value\n    Blocks\n    Times out\n  \n  \n    Insert\n  \
            \  add(e)\n    offer(e)\n    put(e)\n    offer(e, time, unit)\n  \n  \n\
            \    Remove\n    remove()\n    poll()\n    take()\n    poll(time, unit)\n\
            \  \n  \n    Examine\n    element()\n    peek()\n    not applicable\n\
            \    not applicable\n  \n \n\n A BlockingQueue does not accept null elements.\n\
            \ Implementations throw NullPointerException on attempts\n to add, put\
            \ or offer a null.  A\n null is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure\
            \ of\n poll operations.\n\n A BlockingQueue may be capacity bounded. At\
            \ any given\n time it may have a remainingCapacity beyond which no\n additional\
            \ elements can be put without blocking.\n A BlockingQueue without any\
            \ intrinsic capacity constraints always\n reports a remaining capacity\
            \ of Integer.MAX_VALUE.\n\n BlockingQueue implementations are designed\
            \ to be used\n primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally\
            \ support\n the Collection interface.  So, for example, it is\n possible\
            \ to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using\n remove(x). However,\
            \ such operations are in general\n not performed very efficiently, and\
            \ are intended for only\n occasional use, such as when a queued message\
            \ is cancelled.\n\n BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe.  All\n\
            \ queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal\n locks\
            \ or other forms of concurrency control. However, the\n bulk Collection\
            \ operations addAll,\n containsAll, retainAll and removeAll are\n not\
            \ necessarily performed atomically unless specified\n otherwise in an\
            \ implementation. So it is possible, for example, for\n addAll(c) to fail\
            \ (throwing an exception) after adding\n only some of the elements in\
            \ c.\n\n A BlockingQueue does not intrinsically support\n any kind of\
            \ &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to\n indicate that\
            \ no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of\n such features\
            \ tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a\n common tactic\
            \ is for producers to insert special\n end-of-stream or poison objects,\
            \ that are\n interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.\n\n \n Usage\
            \ example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.\n Note that\
            \ a BlockingQueue can safely be used with multiple\n producers and multiple\
            \ consumers.\n  <code>\n class Producer implements Runnable {\n   private\
            \ final BlockingQueue queue;\n   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q;\
            \ }\n   public void run() {\n     try {\n       while (true) { queue.put(produce());\
            \ }\n     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}\n   }\n\
            \   Object produce() { ... }\n }\n\n class Consumer implements Runnable\
            \ {\n   private final BlockingQueue queue;\n   Consumer(BlockingQueue\
            \ q) { queue = q; }\n   public void run() {\n     try {\n       while\
            \ (true) { consume(queue.take()); }\n     } catch (InterruptedException\
            \ ex) { ... handle ...}\n   }\n   void consume(Object x) { ... }\n }\n\
            \n class Setup {\n   void main() {\n     BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();\n\
            \     Producer p = new Producer(q);\n     Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q);\n\
            \     Consumer c2 = new Consumer(q);\n     new Thread(p).start();\n  \
            \   new Thread(c1).start();\n     new Thread(c2).start();\n   }\n }</code>\n\
            \n Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent\n collections,\
            \ actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a\n BlockingQueue\n\
            \ happen-before\n actions subsequent to the access or removal of that\
            \ element from\n the BlockingQueue in another thread.\n\n This interface\
            \ is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
