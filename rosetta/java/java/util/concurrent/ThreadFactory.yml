          notes: "An object that creates new threads on demand.  Using thread factories\n\
            \ removes hardwiring of calls to new Thread,\n enabling applications to\
            \ use special thread subclasses, priorities, etc.\n\n \n The simplest\
            \ implementation of this interface is just:\n  <code>\n class SimpleThreadFactory\
            \ implements ThreadFactory {\n   public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {\n\
            \     return new Thread(r);\n   }\n }</code>\n\n The Executors.defaultThreadFactory()\
            \ method provides a more\n useful simple implementation, that sets the\
            \ created thread context\n to known values before returning it."
