          notes: "An unbounded blocking queue of\n Delayed elements, in which an element\
            \ can only be taken\n when its delay has expired.  The head of the queue\
            \ is that\n Delayed element whose delay expired furthest in the\n past.\
            \  If no delay has expired there is no head and poll\n will return null.\
            \ Expiration occurs when an element's\n getDelay(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)\
            \ method returns a value less\n than or equal to zero.  Even though unexpired\
            \ elements cannot be\n removed using take or poll, they are otherwise\n\
            \ treated as normal elements. For example, the size method\n returns the\
            \ count of both expired and unexpired elements.\n This queue does not\
            \ permit null elements.\n\n This class and its iterator implement all\
            \ of the optional\n methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces.\n\
            \ The Iterator provided in method iterator() is not\n guaranteed to traverse\
            \ the elements of the DelayQueue in any\n particular order.\n\n This class\
            \ is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."

            notes: "Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue;\
              \ the\n runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified\
              \ array.\n The returned array elements are in no particular order.\n\
              \ If the queue fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.\n\
              \ Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the\n\
              \ specified array and the size of this queue.\n\n If this queue fits\
              \ in the specified array with room to spare\n (i.e., the array has more\
              \ elements than this queue), the element in\n the array immediately\
              \ following the end of the queue is set to\n null.\n\n Like the toArray()\
              \ method, this method acts as bridge between\n array-based and collection-based\
              \ APIs.  Further, this method allows\n precise control over the runtime\
              \ type of the output array, and may,\n under certain circumstances,\
              \ be used to save allocation costs.\n\n The following code can be used\
              \ to dump a delay queue into a newly\n allocated array of Delayed:\n\
              \n  <code>Delayed[] a = q.toArray(new Delayed[0]);</code>\n\n Note that\
              \ toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to\n toArray()."
