          notes: "Abstract base class for tasks that run within a ForkJoinPool.\n\
            \ A ForkJoinTask is a thread-like entity that is much\n lighter weight\
            \ than a normal thread.  Huge numbers of tasks and\n subtasks may be hosted\
            \ by a small number of actual threads in a\n ForkJoinPool, at the price\
            \ of some usage limitations.\n\n A \"main\" ForkJoinTask begins execution\
            \ when it is\n explicitly submitted to a ForkJoinPool, or, if not already\n\
            \ engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the ForkJoinPool.commonPool()\
            \ via fork(), invoke(), or\n related methods.  Once started, it will usually\
            \ in turn start other\n subtasks.  As indicated by the name of this class,\
            \ many programs\n using ForkJoinTask employ only methods fork() and\n\
            \ join(), or derivatives such as invokeAll.  However, this class also\n\
            \ provides a number of other methods that can come into play in\n advanced\
            \ usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support\n of new forms\
            \ of fork/join processing.\n\n A ForkJoinTask is a lightweight form of\
            \ Future.\n The efficiency of ForkJoinTasks stems from a set of\n restrictions\
            \ (that are only partially statically enforceable)\n reflecting their\
            \ main use as computational tasks calculating pure\n functions or operating\
            \ on purely isolated objects.  The primary\n coordination mechanisms are\
            \ fork(), that arranges\n asynchronous execution, and join(), that doesn't\
            \ proceed\n until the task's result has been computed.  Computations should\n\
            \ ideally avoid synchronized methods or blocks, and should\n minimize\
            \ other blocking synchronization apart from joining other\n tasks or using\
            \ synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to\n cooperate with\
            \ fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also\n not perform blocking\
            \ I/O, and should ideally access variables that\n are completely independent\
            \ of those accessed by other running\n tasks. These guidelines are loosely\
            \ enforced by not permitting\n checked exceptions such as IOExceptions\
            \ to be\n thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked\n\
            \ exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join\n them.\
            \ These exceptions may additionally include RejectedExecutionException\
            \ stemming from internal resource\n exhaustion, such as failure to allocate\
            \ internal task\n queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as\
            \ regular\n exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed\n\
            \ for example using ex.printStackTrace()) of both the thread\n that initiated\
            \ the computation as well as the thread actually\n encountering the exception;\
            \ minimally only the latter.\n\n It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks\
            \ that may block,\n but doing so requires three further considerations:\
            \ (1) Completion\n of few if any other tasks should be dependent on a\
            \ task\n that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async\n\
            \ tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing CountedCompleter)\
            \ often fall into this category.  (2) To minimize\n resource impact, tasks\
            \ should be small; ideally performing only the\n (possibly) blocking action.\
            \ (3) Unless the ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker API is used, or the number\
            \ of possibly\n blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's ForkJoinPool.getParallelism()\
            \ level, the pool cannot guarantee that\n enough threads will be available\
            \ to ensure progress or good\n performance.\n\n The primary method for\
            \ awaiting completion and extracting\n results of a task is join(), but\
            \ there are several variants:\n The Future.get() methods support interruptible\
            \ and/or timed\n waits for completion and report results using Future\n\
            \ conventions. Method invoke() is semantically\n equivalent to fork();\
            \ join() but always attempts to begin\n execution in the current thread.\
            \ The \"quiet\" forms of\n these methods do not extract results or report\
            \ exceptions. These\n may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed,\
            \ and you need\n to delay processing of results or exceptions until all\
            \ complete.\n Method invokeAll (available in multiple versions)\n performs\
            \ the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set\n of tasks\
            \ and joining them all.\n\n In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair\
            \ act like a call\n (fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive\
            \ function. As is\n the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns\
            \ (joins)\n should be performed innermost-first. For example, a.fork();\n\
            \ b.fork(); b.join(); a.join(); is likely to be substantially more\n efficient\
            \ than joining a before b.\n\n The execution status of tasks may be queried\
            \ at several levels\n of detail: isDone() is true if a task completed\
            \ in any way\n (including the case where a task was cancelled without\
            \ executing);\n isCompletedNormally() is true if a task completed without\n\
            \ cancellation or encountering an exception; isCancelled() is\n true if\
            \ the task was cancelled (in which case getException(int)\n returns a\
            \ CancellationException); and\n isCompletedAbnormally() is true if a task\
            \ was either\n cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case getException(int)\
            \ will return either the encountered exception or\n CancellationException.\n\
            \n The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.\n Instead,\
            \ you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a\n particular\
            \ style of fork/join processing, typically RecursiveAction for most computations\
            \ that do not return results,\n RecursiveTask for those that do, and CountedCompleter\
            \ for those in which completed actions trigger\n other actions.  Normally,\
            \ a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares\n fields comprising its parameters,\
            \ established in a constructor, and\n then defines a compute method that\
            \ somehow uses the control\n methods supplied by this base class.\n\n\
            \ Method join() and its variants are appropriate for use\n only when completion\
            \ dependencies are acyclic; that is, the\n parallel computation can be\
            \ described as a directed acyclic graph\n (DAG). Otherwise, executions\
            \ may encounter a form of deadlock as\n tasks cyclically wait for each\
            \ other.  However, this framework\n supports other methods and techniques\
            \ (for example the use of\n Phaser, helpQuiesce(), and complete(V)) that\n\
            \ may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that\n\
            \ are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages, a\n ForkJoinTask\
            \ may be atomically tagged with a short\n value using setForkJoinTaskTag(short)\
            \ or compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag(short, short) and checked using getForkJoinTaskTag().\
            \ The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use\n these protected methods\
            \ or tags for any purpose, but they\n may be of use in the construction\
            \ of specialized subclasses.  For\n example, parallel graph traversals\
            \ can use the supplied methods to\n avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that\
            \ have already been processed.\n (Method names for tagging are bulky in\
            \ part to encourage definition\n of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)\n\
            \n Most base support methods are final, to prevent\n overriding of implementations\
            \ that are intrinsically tied to the\n underlying lightweight task scheduling\
            \ framework.  Developers\n creating new basic styles of fork/join processing\
            \ should minimally\n implement protected methods exec(), setRawResult(V),\
            \ and getRawResult(), while also introducing\n an abstract computational\
            \ method that can be implemented in its\n subclasses, possibly relying\
            \ on other protected methods\n provided by this class.\n\n ForkJoinTasks\
            \ should perform relatively small amounts of\n computation. Large tasks\
            \ should be split into smaller subtasks,\n usually via recursive decomposition.\
            \ As a very rough rule of thumb,\n a task should perform more than 100\
            \ and less than 10000 basic\n computational steps, and should avoid indefinite\
            \ looping. If tasks\n are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput.\
            \ If too\n small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may\n\
            \ overwhelm processing.\n\n This class provides adapt methods for Runnable\n\
            \ and Callable, that may be of use when mixing execution of\n ForkJoinTasks\
            \ with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are\n of this form, consider\
            \ using a pool constructed in asyncMode.\n\n ForkJoinTasks are Serializable,\
            \ which enables them to be\n used in extensions such as remote execution\
            \ frameworks. It is\n sensible to serialize tasks only before or after,\
            \ but not during,\n execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution\
            \ itself."
