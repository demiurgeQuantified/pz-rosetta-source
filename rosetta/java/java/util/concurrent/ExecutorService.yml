          notes: "An Executor that provides methods to manage termination and\n methods\
            \ that can produce a Future for tracking progress of\n one or more asynchronous\
            \ tasks.\n\n An ExecutorService can be shut down, which will cause\n it\
            \ to reject new tasks.  Two different methods are provided for\n shutting\
            \ down an ExecutorService. The shutdown()\n method will allow previously\
            \ submitted tasks to execute before\n terminating, while the shutdownNow()\
            \ method prevents waiting\n tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently\
            \ executing tasks.\n Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively\
            \ executing, no\n tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.\
            \  An\n unused ExecutorService should be shut down to allow\n reclamation\
            \ of its resources.\n\n Method submit extends base method Executor.execute(Runnable)\
            \ by creating and returning a Future\n that can be used to cancel execution\
            \ and/or wait for completion.\n Methods invokeAny and invokeAll perform\
            \ the most\n commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection\
            \ of\n tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to\n complete.\
            \ (Class ExecutorCompletionService can be used to\n write customized variants\
            \ of these methods.)\n\n The Executors class provides factory methods\
            \ for the\n executor services provided in this package.\n\n Usage Examples\n\
            \n Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread\n\
            \ pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int)\
            \ factory method:\n\n  <code>\n class NetworkService implements Runnable\
            \ {\n   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;\n   private final ExecutorService\
            \ pool;\n\n   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)\n       throws\
            \ IOException {\n     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);\n     pool\
            \ = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);\n   }\n\n   public void run()\
            \ { // run the service\n     try {\n       for (;;) {\n         pool.execute(new\
            \ Handler(serverSocket.accept()));\n       }\n     } catch (IOException\
            \ ex) {\n       pool.shutdown();\n     }\n   }\n }\n\n class Handler implements\
            \ Runnable {\n   private final Socket socket;\n   Handler(Socket socket)\
            \ { this.socket = socket; }\n   public void run() {\n     // read and\
            \ service request on socket\n   }\n }</code>\n\n The following method\
            \ shuts down an ExecutorService in two phases,\n first by calling shutdown\
            \ to reject incoming tasks, and then\n calling shutdownNow, if necessary,\
            \ to cancel any lingering tasks:\n\n  <code>\n void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService\
            \ pool) {\n   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted\n\
            \   try {\n     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate\n    \
            \ if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {\n       pool.shutdownNow();\
            \ // Cancel currently executing tasks\n       // Wait a while for tasks\
            \ to respond to being cancelled\n       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60,\
            \ TimeUnit.SECONDS))\n           System.err.println(\"Pool did not terminate\"\
            );\n     }\n   } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n     // (Re-)Cancel\
            \ if current thread also interrupted\n     pool.shutdownNow();\n     //\
            \ Preserve interrupt status\n     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n\
            \   }\n }</code>\n\n Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior\
            \ to the\n submission of a Runnable or Callable task to an\n ExecutorService\n\
            \ happen-before\n any actions taken by that task, which in turn happen-before\
            \ the\n result is retrieved via Future.get()."
