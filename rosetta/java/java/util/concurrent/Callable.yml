          notes: "A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.\n Implementors\
            \ define a single method with no arguments called\n call.\n\n The Callable\
            \ interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes\
            \ whose\n instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A\n Runnable,\
            \ however, does not return a result and cannot\n throw a checked exception.\n\
            \n The Executors class contains utility methods to\n convert from other\
            \ common forms to Callable classes."
