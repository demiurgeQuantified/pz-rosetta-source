          notes: "A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and\n high\
            \ expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the\n same functional\
            \ specification as Hashtable, and\n includes versions of methods corresponding\
            \ to each method of\n Hashtable. However, even though all operations are\n\
            \ thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking,\n and there\
            \ is not any support for locking the entire table\n in a way that prevents\
            \ all access.  This class is fully\n interoperable with Hashtable in programs\
            \ that rely on its\n thread safety but not on its synchronization details.\n\
            \n Retrieval operations (including get) generally do not\n block, so may\
            \ overlap with update operations (including put\n and remove). Retrievals\
            \ reflect the results of the most\n recently completed update operations\
            \ holding upon their\n onset. (More formally, an update operation for\
            \ a given key bears a\n happens-before relation with any (non-null) retrieval\
            \ for\n that key reporting the updated value.)  For aggregate operations\n\
            \ such as putAll and clear, concurrent retrievals may\n reflect insertion\
            \ or removal of only some entries.  Similarly,\n Iterators, Spliterators\
            \ and Enumerations return elements reflecting the\n state of the hash\
            \ table at some point at or since the creation of the\n iterator/enumeration.\
            \  They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.\n However, iterators\
            \ are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.\n Bear in mind\
            \ that the results of aggregate status methods including\n size, isEmpty,\
            \ and containsValue are typically\n useful only when a map is not undergoing\
            \ concurrent updates in other threads.\n Otherwise the results of these\
            \ methods reflect transient states\n that may be adequate for monitoring\
            \ or estimation purposes, but not\n for program control.\n\n The table\
            \ is dynamically expanded when there are too many\n collisions (i.e.,\
            \ keys that have distinct hash codes but fall into\n the same slot modulo\
            \ the table size), with the expected average\n effect of maintaining roughly\
            \ two bins per mapping (corresponding\n to a 0.75 load factor threshold\
            \ for resizing). There may be much\n variance around this average as mappings\
            \ are added and removed, but\n overall, this maintains a commonly accepted\
            \ time/space tradeoff for\n hash tables.  However, resizing this or any\
            \ other kind of hash\n table may be a relatively slow operation. When\
            \ possible, it is a\n good idea to provide a size estimate as an optional\
            \ \n initialCapacity constructor argument. An additional optional\n loadFactor\
            \ constructor argument provides a further means of\n customizing initial\
            \ table capacity by specifying the table density\n to be used in calculating\
            \ the amount of space to allocate for the\n given number of elements.\
            \  Also, for compatibility with previous\n versions of this class, constructors\
            \ may optionally specify an\n expected concurrencyLevel as an additional\
            \ hint for\n internal sizing.  Note that using many keys with exactly\
            \ the same\n hashCode() is a sure way to slow down performance of any\n\
            \ hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys are Comparable,\n this class\
            \ may use comparison order among keys to help break ties.\n\n A Set projection\
            \ of a ConcurrentHashMap may be created\n (using newKeySet() or newKeySet(int)),\
            \ or viewed\n (using keySet(Object) when only keys are of interest, and\
            \ the\n mapped values are (perhaps transiently) not used or all take the\n\
            \ same mapping value.\n\n A ConcurrentHashMap can be used as a scalable\
            \ frequency map (a\n form of histogram or multiset) by using LongAdder\
            \ values and initializing via\n computeIfAbsent. For example, to add a\
            \ count\n to a ConcurrentHashMap<String,LongAdder> freqs, you can use\n\
            \ freqs.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new LongAdder()).increment();\n\n This\
            \ class and its views and iterators implement all of the\n optional methods\
            \ of the Map and Iterator\n interfaces.\n\n Like Hashtable but unlike\
            \ HashMap, this class\n does not allow null to be used as a key or value.\n\
            \n ConcurrentHashMaps support a set of sequential and parallel bulk\n\
            \ operations that, unlike most Stream methods, are designed\n to be safely,\
            \ and often sensibly, applied even with maps that are\n being concurrently\
            \ updated by other threads; for example, when\n computing a snapshot summary\
            \ of the values in a shared registry.\n There are three kinds of operation,\
            \ each with four forms, accepting\n functions with keys, values, entries,\
            \ and (key, value) pairs as\n arguments and/or return values. Because\
            \ the elements of a\n ConcurrentHashMap are not ordered in any particular\
            \ way, and may be\n processed in different orders in different parallel\
            \ executions, the\n correctness of supplied functions should not depend\
            \ on any\n ordering, or on any other objects or values that may transiently\n\
            \ change while computation is in progress; and except for forEach\n actions,\
            \ should ideally be side-effect-free. Bulk operations on\n Map.Entry objects\
            \ do not support method setValue.\n\n \n forEach: Performs a given action\
            \ on each element.\n A variant form applies a given transformation on\
            \ each element\n before performing the action.\n\n search: Returns the\
            \ first available non-null result of\n applying a given function on each\
            \ element; skipping further\n search when a result is found.\n\n reduce:\
            \ Accumulates each element.  The supplied reduction\n function cannot\
            \ rely on ordering (more formally, it should be\n both associative and\
            \ commutative).  There are five variants:\n\n \n\n Plain reductions. (There\
            \ is not a form of this method for\n (key, value) function arguments since\
            \ there is no corresponding\n return type.)\n\n Mapped reductions that\
            \ accumulate the results of a given\n function applied to each element.\n\
            \n Reductions to scalar doubles, longs, and ints, using a\n given basis\
            \ value.\n\n \n \n\n These bulk operations accept a parallelismThreshold\n\
            \ argument. Methods proceed sequentially if the current map size is\n\
            \ estimated to be less than the given threshold. Using a value of\n Long.MAX_VALUE\
            \ suppresses all parallelism.  Using a value\n of 1 results in maximal\
            \ parallelism by partitioning into\n enough subtasks to fully utilize\
            \ the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() that is used for all parallel\n computations.\
            \ Normally, you would initially choose one of these\n extreme values,\
            \ and then measure performance of using in-between\n values that trade\
            \ off overhead versus throughput.\n\n The concurrency properties of bulk\
            \ operations follow\n from those of ConcurrentHashMap: Any non-null result\
            \ returned\n from get(key) and related access methods bears a\n happens-before\
            \ relation with the associated insertion or\n update.  The result of any\
            \ bulk operation reflects the\n composition of these per-element relations\
            \ (but is not\n necessarily atomic with respect to the map as a whole\
            \ unless it\n is somehow known to be quiescent).  Conversely, because\
            \ keys\n and values in the map are never null, null serves as a reliable\n\
            \ atomic indicator of the current lack of any result.  To\n maintain this\
            \ property, null serves as an implicit basis for\n all non-scalar reduction\
            \ operations. For the double, long, and\n int versions, the basis should\
            \ be one that, when combined with\n any other value, returns that other\
            \ value (more formally, it\n should be the identity element for the reduction).\
            \ Most common\n reductions have these properties; for example, computing\
            \ a sum\n with basis 0 or a minimum with basis MAX_VALUE.\n\n Search and\
            \ transformation functions provided as arguments\n should similarly return\
            \ null to indicate the lack of any result\n (in which case it is not used).\
            \ In the case of mapped\n reductions, this also enables transformations\
            \ to serve as\n filters, returning null (or, in the case of primitive\n\
            \ specializations, the identity basis) if the element should not\n be\
            \ combined. You can create compound transformations and\n filterings by\
            \ composing them yourself under this \"null means\n there is nothing there\
            \ now\" rule before using them in search or\n reduce operations.\n\n Methods\
            \ accepting and/or returning Entry arguments maintain\n key-value associations.\
            \ They may be useful for example when\n finding the key for the greatest\
            \ value. Note that \"plain\" Entry\n arguments can be supplied using new\n\
            \ AbstractMap.SimpleEntry(k,v).\n\n Bulk operations may complete abruptly,\
            \ throwing an\n exception encountered in the application of a supplied\n\
            \ function. Bear in mind when handling such exceptions that other\n concurrently\
            \ executing functions could also have thrown\n exceptions, or would have\
            \ done so if the first exception had\n not occurred.\n\n Speedups for\
            \ parallel compared to sequential forms are common\n but not guaranteed.\
            \  Parallel operations involving brief functions\n on small maps may execute\
            \ more slowly than sequential forms if the\n underlying work to parallelize\
            \ the computation is more expensive\n than the computation itself.  Similarly,\
            \ parallelization may not\n lead to much actual parallelism if all processors\
            \ are busy\n performing unrelated tasks.\n\n All arguments to all task\
            \ methods must be non-null.\n\n This class is a member of the\n \n Java\
            \ Collections Framework."
