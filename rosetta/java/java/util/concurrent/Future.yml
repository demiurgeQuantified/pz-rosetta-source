          notes: "A Future represents the result of an asynchronous\n computation.\
            \  Methods are provided to check if the computation is\n complete, to\
            \ wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of\n the computation.\
            \  The result can only be retrieved using method\n get when the computation\
            \ has completed, blocking if\n necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation\
            \ is performed by the\n cancel method.  Additional methods are provided\
            \ to\n determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once\
            \ a\n computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.\n\
            \ If you would like to use a Future for the sake\n of cancellability but\
            \ not provide a usable result, you can\n declare types of the form Future<?>\
            \ and\n return null as a result of the underlying task.\n\n Sample Usage\
            \ (Note that the following classes are all\n made-up.)\n\n  <code>\n interface\
            \ ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }\n class App {\n  \
            \ ExecutorService executor = ...;\n   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...;\n\
            \   void showSearch(String target) throws InterruptedException {\n   \
            \  Callable<String> task = () -> searcher.search(target);\n     Future<String>\
            \ future = executor.submit(task);\n     displayOtherThings(); // do other\
            \ things while searching\n     try {\n       displayText(future.get());\
            \ // use future\n     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return;\
            \ }\n   }\n }</code>\n\n The FutureTask class is an implementation of\
            \ Future that\n implements Runnable, and so may be executed by an Executor.\n\
            \ For example, the above construction with submit could be replaced by:\n\
            \  <code>\n FutureTask<String> future = new FutureTask<>(task);\n executor.execute(future);</code>\n\
            \n Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation\n\
            \  happen-before\n actions following the corresponding Future.get() in\
            \ another thread."

              \ not started when cancel is called, this task\n should never run. \
              \ If the task has already started, then the\n mayInterruptIfRunning\

              \ the task.\n\n The return value from this method does not necessarily\n\
              \ indicate whether the task is now cancelled; use isCancelled()."
