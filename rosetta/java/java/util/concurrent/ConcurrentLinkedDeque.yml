          notes: "An unbounded concurrent deque based on linked nodes.\n Concurrent\
            \ insertion, removal, and access operations execute safely\n across multiple\
            \ threads.\n A ConcurrentLinkedDeque is an appropriate choice when\n many\
            \ threads will share access to a common collection.\n Like most other\
            \ concurrent collection implementations, this class\n does not permit\
            \ the use of null elements.\n\n Iterators and spliterators are\n weakly\
            \ consistent.\n\n Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method\n\
            \ is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the\n asynchronous nature\
            \ of these deques, determining the current number\n of elements requires\
            \ a traversal of the elements, and so may report\n inaccurate results\
            \ if this collection is modified during traversal.\n\n Bulk operations\
            \ that add, remove, or examine multiple elements,\n such as addAll(java.util.Collection<?\
            \ extends E>), removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate<? super E>) or forEach(java.util.function.Consumer<?\
            \ super E>),\n are not guaranteed to be performed atomically.\n For example,\
            \ a forEach traversal concurrent with an \n addAll operation might observe\
            \ only some of the added elements.\n\n This class and its iterator implement\
            \ all of the optional\n methods of the Deque and Iterator interfaces.\n\
            \n Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections,\n\
            \ actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a\n ConcurrentLinkedDeque\n\
            \ happen-before\n actions subsequent to the access or removal of that\
            \ element from\n the ConcurrentLinkedDeque in another thread.\n\n This\
            \ class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
