          notes: "An object that implements the Enumeration interface generates a\n\
            \ series of elements, one at a time. Successive calls to the\n nextElement\
            \ method return successive elements of the\n series.\n \n For example,\
            \ to print all elements of a Vector<E> v:\n \n   for (Enumeration<E> e\
            \ = v.elements(); e.hasMoreElements();)\n       System.out.println(e.nextElement());\n\
            \ \n Methods are provided to enumerate through the elements of a\n vector,\
            \ the keys of a hashtable, and the values in a hashtable.\n Enumerations\
            \ are also used to specify the input streams to a\n SequenceInputStream."

            notes: "Returns an Iterator that traverses the remaining elements\n covered\
              \ by this enumeration. Traversal is undefined if any methods\n are called\
