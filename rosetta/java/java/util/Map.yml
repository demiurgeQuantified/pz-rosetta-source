          notes: "An object that maps keys to values.  A map cannot contain duplicate\
            \ keys;\n each key can map to at most one value.\n\n This interface takes\
            \ the place of the Dictionary class, which\n was a totally abstract class\
            \ rather than an interface.\n\n The Map interface provides three collection\
            \ views, which\n allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys,\
            \ collection of values,\n or set of key-value mappings.  The order of\
            \ a map is defined as\n the order in which the iterators on the map's\
            \ collection views return their\n elements.  Some map implementations,\
            \ like the TreeMap class, make\n specific guarantees as to their order;\
            \ others, like the HashMap\n class, do not.\n\n Note: great care must\
            \ be exercised if mutable objects are used as map\n keys.  The behavior\
            \ of a map is not specified if the value of an object is\n changed in\
            \ a manner that affects equals comparisons while the\n object is a key\
            \ in the map.  A special case of this prohibition is that it\n is not\
            \ permissible for a map to contain itself as a key.  While it is\n permissible\
            \ for a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is\n advised:\
            \ the equals and hashCode methods are no longer\n well defined on such\
            \ a map.\n\n All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide\
            \ two\n \"standard\" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which\
            \ creates an\n empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of\
            \ type Map,\n which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings\
            \ as its argument.\n In effect, the latter constructor allows the user\
            \ to copy any map,\n producing an equivalent map of the desired class.\
            \  There is no way to\n enforce this recommendation (as interfaces cannot\
            \ contain constructors) but\n all of the general-purpose map implementations\
            \ in the JDK comply.\n\n The \"destructive\" methods contained in this\
            \ interface, that is, the\n methods that modify the map on which they\
            \ operate, are specified to throw\n UnsupportedOperationException if this\
            \ map does not support the\n operation.  If this is the case, these methods\
            \ may, but are not required\n to, throw an UnsupportedOperationException\
            \ if the invocation would\n have no effect on the map.  For example, invoking\
            \ the putAll(Map)\n method on an unmodifiable map may, but is not required\
            \ to, throw the\n exception if the map whose mappings are to be \"superimposed\"\
            \ is empty.\n\n Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys\
            \ and values they\n may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit\
            \ null keys and\n values, and some have restrictions on the types of their\
            \ keys.  Attempting\n to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked\
            \ exception,\n typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException.\n\
            \ Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw\
            \ an\n exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations\
            \ will exhibit\n the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter.\
            \  More generally,\n attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value\
            \ whose completion\n would not result in the insertion of an ineligible\
            \ element into the map may\n throw an exception or it may succeed, at\
            \ the option of the implementation.\n Such exceptions are marked as \"\
            optional\" in the specification for this\n interface.\n\n Many methods\
            \ in Collections Framework interfaces are defined\n in terms of the equals\
            \ method.  For\n example, the specification for the containsKey(Object\
            \ key) method says: \"returns true if and\n only if this map contains\
            \ a mapping for a key k such that\n (key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k)).\"\
            \ This specification should\n not be construed to imply that invoking\
            \ Map.containsKey\n with a non-null argument key will cause key.equals(k)\
            \ to\n be invoked for any key k.  Implementations are free to\n implement\
            \ optimizations whereby the equals invocation is avoided,\n for example,\
            \ by first comparing the hash codes of the two keys.  (The\n Object.hashCode()\
            \ specification guarantees that two objects with\n unequal hash codes\
            \ cannot be equal.)  More generally, implementations of\n the various\
            \ Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of\n the\
            \ specified behavior of underlying Object methods wherever the\n implementor\
            \ deems it appropriate.\n\n Some map operations which perform recursive\
            \ traversal of the map may fail\n with an exception for self-referential\
            \ instances where the map directly or\n indirectly contains itself. This\
            \ includes the clone(),\n equals(), hashCode() and toString() methods.\n\
            \ Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario,\
            \ however\n most current implementations do not do so.\n\n Unmodifiable\
            \ Maps\n The Map.of,\n Map.ofEntries, and\n Map.copyOf\n static factory\
            \ methods provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable maps.\n The\
            \ Map\n instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:\n\
            \n \n They are unmodifiable. Keys and values\n cannot be added, removed,\
            \ or updated. Calling any mutator method on the Map\n will always cause\
            \ UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown.\n However, if the contained\
            \ keys or values are themselves mutable, this may cause the\n Map to behave\
            \ inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.\n They disallow\
            \ null keys and values. Attempts to create them with\n null keys or values\
            \ result in NullPointerException.\n They are serializable if all keys\
            \ and values are serializable.\n They reject duplicate keys at creation\
            \ time. Duplicate keys\n passed to a static factory method result in IllegalArgumentException.\n\
            \ The iteration order of mappings is unspecified and is subject to change.\n\
            \ They are value-based.\n Programmers should treat instances that are\
            \ equal\n as interchangeable and should not use them for synchronization,\
            \ or\n unpredictable behavior may occur. For example, in a future release,\n\
            \ synchronization may fail. Callers should make no assumptions\n about\
            \ the identity of the returned instances. Factories are free to\n create\
            \ new instances or reuse existing ones.\n They are serialized as specified\
            \ on the\n Serialized Form\n page.\n \n\n This interface is a member of\
            \ the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
