          notes: "This class provides a skeletal implementation of the List\n interface\
            \ to minimize the effort required to implement this interface\n backed\
            \ by a \"random access\" data store (such as an array).  For sequential\n\
            \ access data (such as a linked list), AbstractSequentialList should\n\
            \ be used in preference to this class.\n\n To implement an unmodifiable\
            \ list, the programmer needs only to extend\n this class and provide implementations\
            \ for the get(int) and\n size() methods.\n\n To implement a modifiable\
            \ list, the programmer must additionally\n override the set(int, E) method\
            \ (which otherwise\n throws an UnsupportedOperationException).  If the\
            \ list is\n variable-size the programmer must additionally override the\n\
            \ add(int, E) and remove(int) methods.\n\n The programmer should generally\
            \ provide a void (no argument) and collection\n constructor, as per the\
            \ recommendation in the Collection interface\n specification.\n\n Unlike\
            \ the other abstract collection implementations, the programmer does\n\
            \ not have to provide an iterator implementation; the iterator and\n list\
            \ iterator are implemented by this class, on top of the \"random access\"\
            \n methods:\n get(int),\n set(int, E),\n add(int, E) and\n remove(int).\n\
            \n The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes\
            \ its\n implementation in detail.  Each of these methods may be overridden\
            \ if the\n collection being implemented admits a more efficient implementation.\n\
            \n This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."

              notes: "The number of times this list has been structurally modified.\n\
                \ Structural modifications are those that change the size of the\n\
                \ list, or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations\
                \ in\n progress may yield incorrect results.\n\n This field is used\
                \ by the iterator and list iterator implementation\n returned by the\
                \ iterator and listIterator methods.\n If the value of this field\
                \ changes unexpectedly, the iterator (or list\n iterator) will throw\
                \ a ConcurrentModificationException in\n response to the next, remove,\
                \ previous,\n set or add operations.  This provides\n fail-fast behavior,\
                \ rather than non-deterministic behavior in\n the face of concurrent\
                \ modification during iteration.\n\n Use of this field by subclasses\
                \ is optional. If a subclass\n wishes to provide fail-fast iterators\
                \ (and list iterators), then it\n merely has to increment this field\
                \ in its add(int, E) and\n remove(int) methods (and any other methods\
                \ that it overrides\n that result in structural modifications to the\
                \ list).  A single call to\n add(int, E) or remove(int) must add no\
                \ more than\n one to this field, or the iterators (and list iterators)\
                \ will throw\n bogus ConcurrentModificationExceptions.  If an implementation\n\
                \ does not wish to provide fail-fast iterators, this field may be\n\
                \ ignored."
