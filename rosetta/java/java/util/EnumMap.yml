          notes: "A specialized Map implementation for use with enum type keys.  All\n\
            \ of the keys in an enum map must come from a single enum type that is\n\
            \ specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the map is created.  Enum\
            \ maps\n are represented internally as arrays.  This representation is\
            \ extremely\n compact and efficient.\n\n Enum maps are maintained in the\
            \ natural order of their keys\n (the order in which the enum constants\
            \ are declared).  This is reflected\n in the iterators returned by the\
            \ collections views (keySet(),\n entrySet(), and values()).\n\n Iterators\
            \ returned by the collection views are weakly consistent:\n they will\
            \ never throw ConcurrentModificationException and they may\n or may not\
            \ show the effects of any modifications to the map that occur while\n\
            \ the iteration is in progress.\n\n Null keys are not permitted.  Attempts\
            \ to insert a null key will\n throw NullPointerException.  Attempts to\
            \ test for the\n presence of a null key or to remove one will, however,\
            \ function properly.\n Null values are permitted.\n\n Like most collection\
            \ implementations EnumMap is not\n synchronized. If multiple threads access\
            \ an enum map concurrently, and at\n least one of the threads modifies\
            \ the map, it should be synchronized\n externally.  This is typically\
            \ accomplished by synchronizing on some\n object that naturally encapsulates\
            \ the enum map.  If no such object exists,\n the map should be \"wrapped\"\
            \ using the Collections.synchronizedMap(java.util.Map<K, V>)\n method.\
            \  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized\
            \ access:\n\n \n     Map<EnumKey, V> m\n         = Collections.synchronizedMap(new\
            \ EnumMap<EnumKey, V>(...));\n \n\n Implementation note: All basic operations\
            \ execute in constant time.\n They are likely (though not guaranteed)\
            \ to be faster than their\n HashMap counterparts.\n\n This class is a\
            \ member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
