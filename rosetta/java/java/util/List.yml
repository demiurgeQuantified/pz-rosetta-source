          notes: "An ordered collection (also known as a sequence).  The user of this\n\
            \ interface has precise control over where in the list each element is\n\
            \ inserted.  The user can access elements by their integer index (position\
            \ in\n the list), and search for elements in the list.\n\n Unlike sets,\
            \ lists typically allow duplicate elements.  More formally,\n lists typically\
            \ allow pairs of elements e1 and e2\n such that e1.equals(e2), and they\
            \ typically allow multiple\n null elements if they allow null elements\
            \ at all.  It is not inconceivable\n that someone might wish to implement\
            \ a list that prohibits duplicates, by\n throwing runtime exceptions when\
            \ the user attempts to insert them, but we\n expect this usage to be rare.\n\
            \n The List interface places additional stipulations, beyond those\n specified\
            \ in the Collection interface, on the contracts of the\n iterator, add,\
            \ remove, equals, and\n hashCode methods.  Declarations for other inherited\
            \ methods are\n also included here for convenience.\n\n The List interface\
            \ provides four methods for positional (indexed)\n access to list elements.\
            \  Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.  Note\n that these operations\
            \ may execute in time proportional to the index value\n for some implementations\
            \ (the LinkedList class, for\n example). Thus, iterating over the elements\
            \ in a list is typically\n preferable to indexing through it if the caller\
            \ does not know the\n implementation.\n\n The List interface provides\
            \ a special iterator, called a\n ListIterator, that allows element insertion\
            \ and replacement, and\n bidirectional access in addition to the normal\
            \ operations that the\n Iterator interface provides.  A method is provided\
            \ to obtain a\n list iterator that starts at a specified position in the\
            \ list.\n\n The List interface provides two methods to search for a specified\n\
            \ object.  From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used\
            \ with\n caution.  In many implementations they will perform costly linear\n\
            \ searches.\n\n The List interface provides two methods to efficiently\
            \ insert and\n remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list.\n\
            \n Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as elements,\n\
            \ extreme caution is advised: the equals and hashCode\n methods are no\
            \ longer well defined on such a list.\n\n Some list implementations have\
            \ restrictions on the elements that\n they may contain.  For example,\
            \ some implementations prohibit null elements,\n and some have restrictions\
            \ on the types of their elements.  Attempting to\n add an ineligible element\
            \ throws an unchecked exception, typically\n NullPointerException or ClassCastException.\
            \  Attempting\n to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw\
            \ an exception,\n or it may simply return false; some implementations\
            \ will exhibit the former\n behavior and some will exhibit the latter.\
            \  More generally, attempting an\n operation on an ineligible element\
            \ whose completion would not result in\n the insertion of an ineligible\
            \ element into the list may throw an\n exception or it may succeed, at\
            \ the option of the implementation.\n Such exceptions are marked as \"\
            optional\" in the specification for this\n interface.\n\n Unmodifiable\
            \ Lists\n The List.of and\n List.copyOf static factory methods\n provide\
            \ a convenient way to create unmodifiable lists. The List\n instances\
            \ created by these methods have the following characteristics:\n\n \n\
            \ They are unmodifiable. Elements cannot\n be added, removed, or replaced.\
            \ Calling any mutator method on the List\n will always cause UnsupportedOperationException\
            \ to be thrown.\n However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable,\n\
            \ this may cause the List's contents to appear to change.\n They disallow\
            \ null elements. Attempts to create them with\n null elements result in\
            \ NullPointerException.\n They are serializable if all elements are serializable.\n\
            \ The order of elements in the list is the same as the order of the\n\
            \ provided arguments, or of the elements in the provided array.\n The\
            \ lists and their subList views implement the\n RandomAccess interface.\n\
            \ They are value-based.\n Programmers should treat instances that are\
            \ equal\n as interchangeable and should not use them for synchronization,\
            \ or\n unpredictable behavior may occur. For example, in a future release,\n\
            \ synchronization may fail. Callers should make no assumptions about the\n\
            \ identity of the returned instances. Factories are free to\n create new\
            \ instances or reuse existing ones.\n They are serialized as specified\
            \ on the\n Serialized Form\n page.\n \n\n This interface is a member of\
            \ the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
