          notes: "A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.\n\
            \ Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide\n additional insertion,\
            \ extraction, and inspection operations.\n Each of these methods exists\
            \ in two forms: one throws an exception\n if the operation fails, the\
            \ other returns a special value (either\n null or false, depending on\
            \ the operation).  The\n latter form of the insert operation is designed\
            \ specifically for\n use with capacity-restricted Queue implementations;\
            \ in most\n implementations, insert operations cannot fail.\n\n \n Summary\
            \ of Queue methods\n  \n  \n    \n    Throws exception\n    Returns special\
            \ value\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Insert\n    add(e)\n    offer(e)\n  \n  \n\
            \    Remove\n    remove()\n    poll()\n  \n  \n    Examine\n    element()\n\
            \    peek()\n  \n  \n \n\n Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order\
            \ elements in a\n FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.  Among the exceptions\
            \ are\n priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied\n\
            \ comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or\n\
            \ stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).\n Whatever\
            \ the ordering used, the head of the queue is that\n element which would\
            \ be removed by a call to remove() or\n poll().  In a FIFO queue, all\
            \ new elements are inserted at\n the tail of the queue. Other kinds of\
            \ queues may use\n different placement rules.  Every Queue implementation\n\
            \ must specify its ordering properties.\n\n The offer method inserts an\
            \ element if possible,\n otherwise returning false.  This differs from\
            \ the Collection.add method, which can fail to\n add an element only by\
            \ throwing an unchecked exception.  The\n offer method is designed for\
            \ use when failure is a normal,\n rather than exceptional occurrence,\
            \ for example, in fixed-capacity\n (or &quot;bounded&quot;) queues.\n\n\
            \ The remove() and poll() methods remove and\n return the head of the\
            \ queue.\n Exactly which element is removed from the queue is a\n function\
            \ of the queue's ordering policy, which differs from\n implementation\
            \ to implementation. The remove() and\n poll() methods differ only in\
            \ their behavior when the\n queue is empty: the remove() method throws\
            \ an exception,\n while the poll() method returns null.\n\n The element()\
            \ and peek() methods return, but do\n not remove, the head of the queue.\n\
            \n The Queue interface does not define the blocking queue\n methods, which\
            \ are common in concurrent programming.  These methods,\n which wait for\
            \ elements to appear or for space to become available, are\n defined in\
            \ the BlockingQueue interface, which\n extends this interface.\n\n Queue\
            \ implementations generally do not allow insertion\n of null elements,\
            \ although some implementations, such as\n LinkedList, do not prohibit\
            \ insertion of null.\n Even in the implementations that permit it, null\
            \ should\n not be inserted into a Queue, as null is also\n used as a special\
            \ return value by the poll method to\n indicate that the queue contains\
            \ no elements.\n\n Queue implementations generally do not define\n element-based\
            \ versions of methods equals and\n hashCode but instead inherit the identity\
            \ based versions\n from class Object, because element-based equality is\
            \ not\n always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different\n\
            \ ordering properties.\n\n This interface is a member of the\n \n Java\
            \ Collections Framework."
