          notes: "A NavigableSet implementation based on a TreeMap.\n The elements\
            \ are ordered using their natural\n ordering, or by a Comparator provided\
            \ at set creation\n time, depending on which constructor is used.\n\n\
            \ This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic\n\
            \ operations (add, remove and contains).\n\n Note that the ordering maintained\
            \ by a set (whether or not an explicit\n comparator is provided) must\
            \ be consistent with equals if it is to\n correctly implement the Set\
            \ interface.  (See Comparable\n or Comparator for a precise definition\
            \ of consistent with\n equals.)  This is so because the Set interface\
            \ is defined in\n terms of the equals operation, but a TreeSet instance\n\
            \ performs all element comparisons using its compareTo (or\n compare)\
            \ method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method\n are,\
            \ from the standpoint of the set, equal.  The behavior of a set\n is well-defined\
            \ even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it\n just fails to\
            \ obey the general contract of the Set interface.\n\n Note that this implementation\
            \ is not synchronized.\n If multiple threads access a tree set concurrently,\
            \ and at least one\n of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized\n\
            \ externally.  This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some\n\
            \ object that naturally encapsulates the set.\n If no such object exists,\
            \ the set should be \"wrapped\" using the\n Collections.synchronizedSortedSet\n\
            \ method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental\n\
            \ unsynchronized access to the set: \n   SortedSet s = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new\
            \ TreeSet(...));\n\n The iterators returned by this class's iterator method\
            \ are\n fail-fast: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator\
            \ is\n created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove\n\
            \ method, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\n\
            \ Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly\n\
            \ and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior\
            \ at\n an undetermined time in the future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking,\
            \ impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized\
            \ concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException\
            \ on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program\
            \ that depended on this\n exception for its correctness:   the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n This\
            \ class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
