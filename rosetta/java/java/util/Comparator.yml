          notes: "A comparison function, which imposes a total ordering on\n some\
            \ collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort\n method\
            \ (such as Collections.sort or Arrays.sort) to allow precise control over\
            \ the sort order.\n Comparators can also be used to control the order\
            \ of certain data\n structures (such as sorted sets or\n sorted maps),\
            \ or to provide an ordering for\n collections of objects that don't have\
            \ a natural ordering.\n\n The ordering imposed by a comparator c on a\
            \ set of elements\n S is said to be consistent with equals if and only\
            \ if\n c.compare(e1, e2)==0 has the same boolean value as\n e1.equals(e2)\
            \ for every e1 and e2 in\n S.\n\n Caution should be exercised when using\
            \ a comparator capable of imposing an\n ordering inconsistent with equals\
            \ to order a sorted set (or sorted map).\n Suppose a sorted set (or sorted\
            \ map) with an explicit comparator c\n is used with elements (or keys)\
            \ drawn from a set S.  If the\n ordering imposed by c on S is inconsistent\
            \ with equals,\n the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave \"strangely.\"\
            \  In particular the\n sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general\
            \ contract for set (or\n map), which is defined in terms of equals.\n\n\
            \ For example, suppose one adds two elements a and b such that\n (a.equals(b)\
            \ && c.compare(a, b) != 0)\n to an empty TreeSet with comparator c.\n\
            \ The second add operation will return\n true (and the size of the tree\
            \ set will increase) because a and\n b are not equivalent from the tree\
            \ set's perspective, even though\n this is contrary to the specification\
            \ of the\n Set.add method.\n\n Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators\
            \ to also implement\n java.io.Serializable, as they may be used as ordering\
            \ methods in\n serializable data structures (like TreeSet, TreeMap). \
            \ In\n order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator\
            \ (if\n provided) must implement Serializable.\n\n For the mathematically\
            \ inclined, the relation that defines the\n imposed ordering that a given\
            \ comparator c imposes on a\n given set of objects S is:\n       {(x,\
            \ y) such that c.compare(x, y) <= 0}.\n  The quotient for this total order\
            \ is:\n       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) == 0}.\n \n\n It follows\
            \ immediately from the contract for compare that the\n quotient is an\
            \ equivalence relation on S, and that the\n imposed ordering is a total\
            \ order on S.  When we say that\n the ordering imposed by c on S is consistent\
            \ with\n equals, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence\n\
            \ relation defined by the objects' equals(Object) method(s):\n     {(x,\
            \ y) such that x.equals(y)}. \n\n In other words, when the imposed ordering\
            \ is consistent with\n equals, the equivalence classes defined by the\
            \ equivalence relation\n of the equals method and the equivalence classes\
            \ defined by\n the quotient of the compare method are the same.\n\n Unlike\
            \ Comparable, a comparator may optionally permit\n comparison of null\
            \ arguments, while maintaining the requirements for\n an equivalence relation.\n\
            \n This interface is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
