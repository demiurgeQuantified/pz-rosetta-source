          notes: "The Calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods\n\
            \ for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar\
            \ fields such as YEAR, MONTH,\n DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for\n\
            \ manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next\n\
            \ week. An instant in time can be represented by a millisecond value that\
            \ is\n an offset from the Epoch, January 1, 1970\n 00:00:00.000 GMT (Gregorian).\n\
            \n The class also provides additional fields and methods for\n implementing\
            \ a concrete calendar system outside the package. Those\n fields and methods\
            \ are defined as protected.\n\n \n Like other locale-sensitive classes,\
            \ Calendar provides a\n class method, getInstance, for getting a generally\
            \ useful\n object of this type. Calendar's getInstance method\n returns\
            \ a Calendar object whose\n calendar fields have been initialized with\
            \ the current date and time:\n \n \n     Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();\n\
            \ \n \n\n A Calendar object can produce all the calendar field values\n\
            \ needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language\
            \ and\n calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).\n\
            \ Calendar defines the range of values returned by\n certain calendar\
            \ fields, as well as their meaning.  For example,\n the first month of\
            \ the calendar system has value MONTH ==\n JANUARY for all calendars.\
            \  Other values are defined by the\n concrete subclass, such as ERA. \
            \ See individual field\n documentation and subclass documentation for\
            \ details.\n\n Getting and Setting Calendar Field Values\n\n The calendar\
            \ field values can be set by calling the set\n methods. Any field values\
            \ set in a Calendar will not be\n interpreted until it needs to calculate\
            \ its time value (milliseconds from\n the Epoch) or values of the calendar\
            \ fields. Calling the\n get, getTimeInMillis, getTime,\n add and roll\
            \ involves such calculation.\n\n Leniency\n\n Calendar has two modes for\
            \ interpreting the calendar\n fields, lenient and non-lenient.  When a\n\
            \ Calendar is in lenient mode, it accepts a wider range of\n calendar\
            \ field values than it produces.  When a Calendar\n recomputes calendar\
            \ field values for return by get(), all of\n the calendar fields are normalized.\
            \ For example, a lenient\n GregorianCalendar interprets MONTH == JANUARY,\n\
            \ DAY_OF_MONTH == 32 as February 1.\n\n When a Calendar is in non-lenient\
            \ mode, it throws an\n exception if there is any inconsistency in its\
            \ calendar fields. For\n example, a GregorianCalendar always produces\n\
            \ DAY_OF_MONTH values between 1 and the length of the month. A\n non-lenient\
            \ GregorianCalendar throws an exception upon\n calculating its time or\
            \ calendar field values if any out-of-range field\n value has been set.\n\
            \n First Week\n\n Calendar defines a locale-specific seven day week using\
            \ two\n parameters: the first day of the week and the minimal days in\
            \ first week\n (from 1 to 7).  These numbers are taken from the locale\
            \ resource data or the\n locale itself when a Calendar is constructed.\
            \ If the designated\n locale contains \"fw\" and/or \"rg\" \n Unicode\
            \ extensions, the first day of the week will be obtained according to\n\
            \ those extensions. If both \"fw\" and \"rg\" are specified, the value\
            \ from the \"fw\"\n extension supersedes the implicit one from the \"\
            rg\" extension.\n They may also be specified explicitly through the methods\
            \ for setting their\n values.\n\n When setting or getting the WEEK_OF_MONTH\
            \ or\n WEEK_OF_YEAR fields, Calendar must determine the\n first week of\
            \ the month or year as a reference point.  The first week of a\n month\
            \ or year is defined as the earliest seven day period beginning on\n getFirstDayOfWeek()\
            \ and containing at least\n getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() days of that month\
            \ or year.  Weeks\n numbered ..., -1, 0 precede the first week; weeks\
            \ numbered 2, 3,... follow\n it.  Note that the normalized numbering returned\
            \ by get() may be\n different.  For example, a specific Calendar subclass\
            \ may\n designate the week before week 1 of a year as week n of\n the\
            \ previous year.\n\n Calendar Fields Resolution\n\n When computing a date\
            \ and time from the calendar fields, there\n may be insufficient information\
            \ for the computation (such as only\n year and month with no day of month),\
            \ or there may be inconsistent\n information (such as Tuesday, July 15,\
            \ 1996 (Gregorian) -- July 15,\n 1996 is actually a Monday). Calendar\
            \ will resolve\n calendar field values to determine the date and time\
            \ in the\n following way.\n\n If there is any conflict in calendar field\
            \ values,\n Calendar gives priorities to calendar fields that have been\
            \ set\n more recently. The following are the default combinations of the\n\
            \ calendar fields. The most recent combination, as determined by the\n\
            \ most recently set single field, will be used.\n\n For the date fields:\n\
            \ \n \n YEAR + MONTH + DAY_OF_MONTH\n YEAR + MONTH + WEEK_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK\n\
            \ YEAR + MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK\n YEAR + DAY_OF_YEAR\n\
            \ YEAR + DAY_OF_WEEK + WEEK_OF_YEAR\n \n\n For the time of day fields:\n\
            \ \n \n HOUR_OF_DAY\n AM_PM + HOUR\n \n\n If there are any calendar fields\
            \ whose values haven't been set in the selected\n field combination, Calendar\
            \ uses their default values. The default\n value of each field may vary\
            \ by concrete calendar systems. For example, in\n GregorianCalendar, the\
            \ default of a field is the same as that\n of the start of the Epoch:\
            \ i.e., YEAR = 1970, MONTH =\n JANUARY, DAY_OF_MONTH = 1, etc.\n\n \n\
            \ Note: There are certain possible ambiguities in\n interpretation of\
            \ certain singular times, which are resolved in the\n following ways:\n\
            \ \n      23:59 is the last minute of the day and 00:00 is the first\n\
            \          minute of the next day. Thus, 23:59 on Dec 31, 1999 < 00:00\
            \ on\n          Jan 1, 2000 < 00:01 on Jan 1, 2000.\n\n      Although\
            \ historically not precise, midnight also belongs to \"am\",\n       \
            \   and noon belongs to \"pm\", so on the same day,\n          12:00 am\
            \ (midnight) < 12:01 am, and 12:00 pm (noon) < 12:01 pm\n \n\n \n The\
            \ date or time format strings are not part of the definition of a\n calendar,\
            \ as those must be modifiable or overridable by the user at\n runtime.\
            \ Use DateFormat\n to format dates.\n\n Field Manipulation\n\n The calendar\
            \ fields can be changed using three methods:\n set(), add(), and roll().\n\
            \n set(f, value) changes calendar field\n f to value.  In addition, it\
            \ sets an\n internal member variable to indicate that calendar field f\
            \ has\n been changed. Although calendar field f is changed immediately,\n\
            \ the calendar's time value in milliseconds is not recomputed until the\
            \ next call to\n get(), getTime(), getTimeInMillis(),\n add(), or roll()\
            \ is made. Thus, multiple calls to\n set() do not trigger multiple, unnecessary\n\
            \ computations. As a result of changing a calendar field using\n set(),\
            \ other calendar fields may also change, depending on the\n calendar field,\
            \ the calendar field value, and the calendar system. In addition,\n get(f)\
            \ will not necessarily return value set by\n the call to the set method\n\
            \ after the calendar fields have been recomputed. The specifics are determined\
            \ by\n the concrete calendar class.\n\n Example: Consider a GregorianCalendar\n\
            \ originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling set(Calendar.MONTH,\n Calendar.SEPTEMBER)\
            \ sets the date to September 31,\n 1999. This is a temporary internal\
            \ representation that resolves to\n October 1, 1999 if getTime() is then\
            \ called. However, a\n call to set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 30) before the\
            \ call to\n getTime() sets the date to September 30, 1999, since\n no\
            \ recomputation occurs after set() itself.\n\n add(f, delta) adds delta\n\
            \ to field f.  This is equivalent to calling set(f,\n get(f) + delta)\
            \ with two adjustments:\n\n \n   Add rule 1. The value of field f\n  \
            \ after the call minus the value of field f before the\n   call is delta,\
            \ modulo any overflow that has occurred in\n   field f. Overflow occurs\
            \ when a field value exceeds its\n   range and, as a result, the next\
            \ larger field is incremented or\n   decremented and the field value is\
            \ adjusted back into its range.\n\n   Add rule 2. If a smaller field is\
            \ expected to be\n   invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal\
            \ to its\n   prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum\
            \ after field\n   f is changed or other constraints, such as time zone\n\
            \   offset changes, then its value is adjusted to be as close\n   as possible\
            \ to its expected value. A smaller field represents a\n   smaller unit\
            \ of time. HOUR is a smaller field than\n   DAY_OF_MONTH. No adjustment\
            \ is made to smaller fields\n   that are not expected to be invariant.\
            \ The calendar system\n   determines what fields are expected to be invariant.\n\
            \ \n\n In addition, unlike set(), add() forces\n an immediate recomputation\
            \ of the calendar's milliseconds and all\n fields.\n\n Example: Consider\
            \ a GregorianCalendar\n originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling add(Calendar.MONTH,\n\
            \ 13) sets the calendar to September 30, 2000. Add rule\n 1 sets the MONTH\
            \ field to September, since\n adding 13 months to August gives September\
            \ of the next year. Since\n DAY_OF_MONTH cannot be 31 in September in\
            \ a\n GregorianCalendar, add rule 2 sets the\n DAY_OF_MONTH to 30, the\
            \ closest possible value. Although\n it is a smaller field, DAY_OF_WEEK\
            \ is not adjusted by\n rule 2, since it is expected to change when the\
            \ month changes in a\n GregorianCalendar.\n\n roll(f, delta) adds\n delta\
            \ to field f without changing larger\n fields. This is equivalent to calling\
            \ add(f, delta) with\n the following adjustment:\n\n \n   Roll rule. Larger\
            \ fields are unchanged after the\n   call. A larger field represents a\
            \ larger unit of\n   time. DAY_OF_MONTH is a larger field than\n   HOUR.\n\
            \ \n\n Example: See GregorianCalendar.roll(int, int).\n\n Usage model.\
            \ To motivate the behavior of\n add() and roll(), consider a user interface\n\
            \ component with increment and decrement buttons for the month, day, and\n\
            \ year, and an underlying GregorianCalendar. If the\n interface reads\
            \ January 31, 1999 and the user presses the month\n increment button,\
            \ what should it read? If the underlying\n implementation uses set(),\
            \ it might read March 3, 1999. A\n better result would be February 28,\
            \ 1999. Furthermore, if the user\n presses the month increment button\
            \ again, it should read March 31,\n 1999, not March 28, 1999. By saving\
            \ the original date and using either\n add() or roll(), depending on whether\
            \ larger\n fields should be affected, the user interface can behave as\
            \ most users\n will intuitively expect."
