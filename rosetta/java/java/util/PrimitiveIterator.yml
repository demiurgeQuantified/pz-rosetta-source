          notes: "A base type for primitive specializations of Iterator.  Specialized\n\
            \ subtypes are provided for int, long, and\n double values.\n\n The specialized\
            \ subtype default implementations of Iterator.next()\n and Iterator.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer)\
            \ box\n primitive values to instances of their corresponding wrapper class.\
            \  Such\n boxing may offset any advantages gained when using the primitive\n\
            \ specializations.  To avoid boxing, the corresponding primitive-based\
            \ methods\n should be used.  For example, PrimitiveIterator.OfInt.nextInt()\
            \ and\n PrimitiveIterator.OfInt.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.IntConsumer)\n\
            \ should be used in preference to PrimitiveIterator.OfInt.next() and\n\
            \ PrimitiveIterator.OfInt.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer).\n\
            \n Iteration of primitive values using boxing-based methods\n next() and\n\
            \ forEachRemaining(),\n does not affect the order in which the values,\
            \ transformed to boxed values,\n are encountered."

              \  Actions are\n performed in the order of iteration, if that order\
              \ is specified.\n Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the\
              \ caller.\n \n The behavior of an iterator is unspecified if the action\
              \ modifies the\n source of elements in any way (even by calling the\
              \ remove\n method or other mutator methods of Iterator subtypes),\n\
              \ unless an overriding class has specified a concurrent modification\
              \ policy.\n \n Subsequent behavior of an iterator is unspecified if\
              \ the action throws an\n exception."
