          notes: "The class Date represents a specific instant\n in time, with millisecond\
            \ precision.\n \n Prior to JDK 1.1, the class Date had two additional\n\
            \ functions.  It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day,\
            \ hour,\n minute, and second values.  It also allowed the formatting and\
            \ parsing\n of date strings.  Unfortunately, the API for these functions\
            \ was not\n amenable to internationalization.  As of JDK 1.1, the\n Calendar\
            \ class should be used to convert between dates and time\n fields and\
            \ the DateFormat class should be used to format and\n parse date strings.\n\
            \ The corresponding methods in Date are deprecated.\n \n Although the\
            \ Date class is intended to reflect\n coordinated universal time (UTC),\
            \ it may not do so exactly,\n depending on the host environment of the\
            \ Java Virtual Machine.\n Nearly all modern operating systems assume that\
            \ 1 day =\n 24 &times; 60 &times; 60 = 86400 seconds\n in all cases. In\
            \ UTC, however, about once every year or two there\n is an extra second,\
            \ called a \"leap second.\" The leap\n second is always added as the last\
            \ second of the day, and always\n on December 31 or June 30. For example,\
            \ the last minute of the\n year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an\
            \ added leap second.\n Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to\
            \ be able to reflect\n the leap-second distinction.\n \n Some computer\
            \ standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean\n time (GMT), which\
            \ is equivalent to universal time (UT).  GMT is\n the \"civil\" name for\
            \ the standard; UT is the\n \"scientific\" name for the same standard.\
            \ The\n distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic\n\
            \ clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all\n\
            \ practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the\n\
            \ earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up\n in complicated\
            \ ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap\n seconds are introduced\
            \ as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within\n 0.9 seconds of UT1, which\
            \ is a version of UT with certain\n corrections applied. There are other\
            \ time and date systems as\n well; for example, the time scale used by\
            \ the satellite-based\n global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized\
            \ to UTC but is\n not adjusted for leap seconds. An interesting source\
            \ of\n further information is the United States Naval Observatory (USNO):\n\
            \ \n     <a href=\"https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO\">https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO</a>\n\
            \ \n \n and the material regarding \"Systems of Time\" at:\n \n     <a\
            \ href=\"https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/systems-of-time\"\
            >https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/systems-of-time</a>\n\
            \ \n \n which has descriptions of various different time systems including\n\
            \ UT, UT1, and UTC.\n \n In all methods of class Date that accept or return\n\
            \ year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds values, the\n following\
            \ representations are used:\n \n A year y is represented by the integer\n\
            \     y - 1900.\n A month is represented by an integer from 0 to 11; 0\
            \ is January,\n     1 is February, and so forth; thus 11 is December.\n\
            \ A date (day of month) is represented by an integer from 1 to 31\n  \
            \   in the usual manner.\n An hour is represented by an integer from 0\
            \ to 23. Thus, the hour\n     from midnight to 1 a.m. is hour 0, and the\
            \ hour from noon to 1\n     p.m. is hour 12.\n A minute is represented\
            \ by an integer from 0 to 59 in the usual manner.\n A second is represented\
            \ by an integer from 0 to 61; the values 60 and\n     61 occur only for\
            \ leap seconds and even then only in Java\n     implementations that actually\
            \ track leap seconds correctly. Because\n     of the manner in which leap\
            \ seconds are currently introduced, it is\n     extremely unlikely that\
            \ two leap seconds will occur in the same\n     minute, but this specification\
            \ follows the date and time conventions\n     for ISO C.\n \n \n In all\
            \ cases, arguments given to methods for these purposes need\n not fall\
            \ within the indicated ranges; for example, a date may be\n specified\
            \ as January 32 and is interpreted as meaning February 1."

              \ the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for\n general use,\
              \ a time-zone offset should be used: \"Sat, 12 Aug 1995\n 13:30:00 GMT+0430\"\
              \ (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich\n meridian). If no time\
              \ zone is specified, the local time zone is\n assumed. GMT and UTC are\
              \ considered equivalent.\n \n The string s is processed from left to\
              \ right, looking for\n data of interest. Any material in s that is within\
              \ the\n ASCII parenthesis characters ( and ) is ignored.\n Parentheses\
              \ may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted\n within s\

              \ 0123456789,+-:/\n and whitespace characters.\n A consecutive sequence\
              \ of decimal digits is treated as a decimal\n number:\n If a number\
              \ is preceded by + or - and a year\n     has already been recognized,\
              \ then the number is a time-zone\n     offset. If the number is less\
              \ than 24, it is an offset measured\n     in hours. Otherwise, it is\
              \ regarded as an offset in minutes,\n     expressed in 24-hour time\
              \ format without punctuation. A\n     preceding - means a westward offset.\
              \ Time zone offsets\n     are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus,\
              \ for example,\n     -5 occurring in the string would mean \"five hours\
              \ west\n     of Greenwich\" and +0430 would mean \"four hours and\n\
              \     thirty minutes east of Greenwich.\" It is permitted for the\n\
              \     string to specify GMT, UT, or UTC\n     redundantly-for example,\
              \ GMT-5 or utc+0430.\n The number is regarded as a year number if one\
              \ of the\n     following conditions is true:\n \n     The number is\
              \ equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a\n         space, comma,\
              \ slash, or end of string\n     The number is less than 70, and both\
              \ a month and a day of\n         the month have already been recognized\n\
              \ \n     If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is\n   \
              \  interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of\n   \
              \  which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after\n     the\
              \ time when the Date class is initialized.\n     After adjusting the\
              \ year number, 1900 is subtracted from\n     it. For example, if the\
              \ current year is 1999 then years in\n     the range 19 to 99 are assumed\
              \ to mean 1919 to 1999, while\n     years from 0 to 18 are assumed to\
              \ mean 2000 to 2018.  Note\n     that this is slightly different from\
              \ the interpretation of\n     years less than 100 that is used in SimpleDateFormat.\n\
              \ If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,\n\
              \     unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is\n\
              \     regarded as a minute.\n If the number is followed by a slash,\
              \ it is regarded as a month\n     (it is decreased by 1 to produce a\
              \ number in the range 0\n     to 11), unless a month has already been\
              \ recognized, in\n     which case it is regarded as a day of the month.\n\
              \ If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or\n \
              \    end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a\n\
              \     minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has\n\
              \     been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;\n\
              \     otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month. \n A consecutive\
              \ sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated\n as follows:\n\
              \ A word that matches AM, ignoring case, is ignored (but\n     the parse\
              \ fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less\n     than 1 or\
              \ greater than 12).\n A word that matches PM, ignoring case, adds 12\n\
              \     to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been\n   \
              \  recognized or is less than 1 or greater than 12).\n Any word that\
              \ matches any prefix of SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY,\n     WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY,\
              \ FRIDAY, or SATURDAY, ignoring\n     case, is ignored. For example,\
              \ sat, Friday, TUE, and\n     Thurs are ignored.\n Otherwise, any word\
              \ that matches any prefix of JANUARY,\n     FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL,\
              \ MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER,\n     OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, or DECEMBER,\
              \ ignoring case, and\n     considering them in the order given here,\
              \ is recognized as\n     specifying a month and is converted to a number\
              \ (0 to\n     11). For example, aug, Sept, april, and\n     NOV are\
              \ recognized as months. So is Ma, which\n     is recognized as MARCH,\
              \ not MAY.\n Any word that matches GMT, UT, or UTC, ignoring\n     case,\
              \ is treated as referring to UTC.\n Any word that matches EST, CST,\
              \ MST, or PST,\n     ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the\
              \ time zone in\n     North America that is five, six, seven, or eight\
              \ hours west of\n     Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches\
              \ EDT, CDT,\n     MDT, or PDT, ignoring case, is recognized as\n   \
              \  referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight\n\
              \     saving time.\n Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is\
              \ converted to a time\n result in one of two ways. If a time zone or\
              \ time-zone offset has been\n recognized, then the year, month, day\
              \ of month, hour, minute, and\n second are interpreted in UTC and then\
              \ the time-zone offset is\n applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day\
              \ of month, hour, minute, and\n second are interpreted in the local\
              \ time zone."
