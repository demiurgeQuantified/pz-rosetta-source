          notes: "A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  More formally,\
            \ sets\n contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that\n e1.equals(e2),\
            \ and at most one null element.  As implied by\n its name, this interface\
            \ models the mathematical set abstraction.\n\n The Set interface places\
            \ additional stipulations, beyond those\n inherited from the Collection\
            \ interface, on the contracts of all\n constructors and on the contracts\
            \ of the add, equals and\n hashCode methods.  Declarations for other inherited\
            \ methods are\n also included here for convenience.  (The specifications\
            \ accompanying these\n declarations have been tailored to the Set interface,\
            \ but they do\n not contain any additional stipulations.)\n\n The additional\
            \ stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,\n that all constructors\
            \ must create a set that contains no duplicate elements\n (as defined\
            \ above).\n\n Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are\
            \ used as set\n elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the\
            \ value of an object\n is changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons\
            \ while the\n object is an element in the set.  A special case of this\
            \ prohibition is\n that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself\
            \ as an element.\n\n Some set implementations have restrictions on the\
            \ elements that\n they may contain.  For example, some implementations\
            \ prohibit null elements,\n and some have restrictions on the types of\
            \ their elements.  Attempting to\n add an ineligible element throws an\
            \ unchecked exception, typically\n NullPointerException or ClassCastException.\
            \  Attempting\n to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw\
            \ an exception,\n or it may simply return false; some implementations\
            \ will exhibit the former\n behavior and some will exhibit the latter.\
            \  More generally, attempting an\n operation on an ineligible element\
            \ whose completion would not result in\n the insertion of an ineligible\
            \ element into the set may throw an\n exception or it may succeed, at\
            \ the option of the implementation.\n Such exceptions are marked as \"\
            optional\" in the specification for this\n interface.\n\n Unmodifiable\
            \ Sets\n The Set.of and\n Set.copyOf static factory methods\n provide\
            \ a convenient way to create unmodifiable sets. The Set\n instances created\
            \ by these methods have the following characteristics:\n\n \n They are\
            \ unmodifiable. Elements cannot\n be added or removed. Calling any mutator\
            \ method on the Set\n will always cause UnsupportedOperationException\
            \ to be thrown.\n However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable,\
            \ this may cause the\n Set to behave inconsistently or its contents to\
            \ appear to change.\n They disallow null elements. Attempts to create\
            \ them with\n null elements result in NullPointerException.\n They are\
            \ serializable if all elements are serializable.\n They reject duplicate\
            \ elements at creation time. Duplicate elements\n passed to a static factory\
            \ method result in IllegalArgumentException.\n The iteration order of\
            \ set elements is unspecified and is subject to change.\n They are value-based.\n\
            \ Programmers should treat instances that are equal\n as interchangeable\
            \ and should not use them for synchronization, or\n unpredictable behavior\
            \ may occur. For example, in a future release,\n synchronization may fail.\
            \ Callers should make no assumptions\n about the identity of the returned\
            \ instances. Factories are free to\n create new instances or reuse existing\
            \ ones.\n They are serialized as specified on the\n Serialized Form\n\
            \ page.\n \n\n This interface is a member of the\n \n Java Collections\
            \ Framework."
