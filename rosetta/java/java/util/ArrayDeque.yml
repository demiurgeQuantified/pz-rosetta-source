          notes: "Resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface.  Array\n\
            \ deques have no capacity restrictions; they grow as necessary to support\n\
            \ usage.  They are not thread-safe; in the absence of external\n synchronization,\
            \ they do not support concurrent access by multiple threads.\n Null elements\
            \ are prohibited.  This class is likely to be faster than\n Stack when\
            \ used as a stack, and faster than LinkedList\n when used as a queue.\n\
            \n Most ArrayDeque operations run in amortized constant time.\n Exceptions\
            \ include\n remove,\n removeFirstOccurrence,\n removeLastOccurrence,\n\
            \ contains,\n iterator.remove(),\n and the bulk operations, all of which\
            \ run in linear time.\n\n The iterators returned by this class's iterator\n\
            \ method are fail-fast: If the deque is modified at any time after\n the\
            \ iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own\n\
            \ remove method, the iterator will generally throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\
            \  Thus, in the face of concurrent\n modification, the iterator fails\
            \ quickly and cleanly, rather than risking\n arbitrary, non-deterministic\
            \ behavior at an undetermined time in the\n future.\n\n Note that the\
            \ fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally\
            \ speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of\
            \ unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw\
            \ ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore,\
            \ it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this\n exception\
            \ for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators\n should be\
            \ used only to detect bugs.\n\n This class and its iterator implement\
            \ all of the\n optional methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces.\n\
            \n This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
