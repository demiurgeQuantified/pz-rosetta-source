          notes: "A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal\
            \ at\n both ends.  The name deque is short for \"double ended queue\"\n\
            \ and is usually pronounced \"deck\".  Most Deque\n implementations place\
            \ no fixed limits on the number of elements\n they may contain, but this\
            \ interface supports capacity-restricted\n deques as well as those with\
            \ no fixed size limit.\n\n This interface defines methods to access the\
            \ elements at both\n ends of the deque.  Methods are provided to insert,\
            \ remove, and\n examine the element.  Each of these methods exists in\
            \ two forms:\n one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other\
            \ returns a\n special value (either null or false, depending on\n the\
            \ operation).  The latter form of the insert operation is\n designed specifically\
            \ for use with capacity-restricted\n Deque implementations; in most implementations,\
            \ insert\n operations cannot fail.\n\n The twelve methods described above\
            \ are summarized in the\n following table:\n\n \n Summary of Deque methods\n\
            \  \n  \n    \n     First Element (Head)\n     Last Element (Tail)\n \
            \ \n  \n    Throws exception\n    Special value\n    Throws exception\n\
            \    Special value\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Insert\n    addFirst(e)\n    offerFirst(e)\n\
            \    addLast(e)\n    offerLast(e)\n  \n  \n    Remove\n    removeFirst()\n\
            \    pollFirst()\n    removeLast()\n    pollLast()\n  \n  \n    Examine\n\
            \    getFirst()\n    peekFirst()\n    getLast()\n    peekLast()\n  \n\
            \  \n \n\n This interface extends the Queue interface.  When a deque is\n\
            \ used as a queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results.  Elements\
            \ are\n added at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning.\
            \  The methods\n inherited from the Queue interface are precisely equivalent\
            \ to\n Deque methods as indicated in the following table:\n\n \n Comparison\
            \ of Queue and Deque methods\n  \n  \n     Queue Method\n     Equivalent\
            \ Deque Method\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    add(e)\n    addLast(e)\n  \n  \n \
            \   offer(e)\n    offerLast(e)\n  \n  \n    remove()\n    removeFirst()\n\
            \  \n  \n    poll()\n    pollFirst()\n  \n  \n    element()\n    getFirst()\n\
            \  \n  \n    peek()\n    peekFirst()\n  \n  \n \n\n Deques can also be\
            \ used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks.  This\n interface should be\
            \ used in preference to the legacy Stack class.\n When a deque is used\
            \ as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the\n beginning of the\
            \ deque.  Stack methods are equivalent to Deque\n methods as indicated\
            \ in the table below:\n\n \n Comparison of Stack and Deque methods\n \
            \ \n  \n     Stack Method\n     Equivalent Deque Method\n  \n  \n  \n\
            \  \n    push(e)\n    addFirst(e)\n  \n  \n    pop()\n    removeFirst()\n\
            \  \n  \n    peek()\n    getFirst()\n  \n  \n \n\n Note that the peek\
            \ method works equally well when\n a deque is used as a queue or a stack;\
            \ in either case, elements are\n drawn from the beginning of the deque.\n\
            \n This interface provides two methods to remove interior\n elements,\
            \ removeFirstOccurrence and\n removeLastOccurrence.\n\n Unlike the List\
            \ interface, this interface does not\n provide support for indexed access\
            \ to elements.\n\n While Deque implementations are not strictly required\n\
            \ to prohibit the insertion of null elements, they are strongly\n encouraged\
            \ to do so.  Users of any Deque implementations\n that do allow null elements\
            \ are strongly encouraged not to\n take advantage of the ability to insert\
            \ nulls.  This is so because\n null is used as a special return value\
            \ by various methods\n to indicate that the deque is empty.\n\n Deque\
            \ implementations generally do not define\n element-based versions of\
            \ the equals and hashCode\n methods, but instead inherit the identity-based\
            \ versions from class\n Object.\n\n This interface is a member of the\n\
            \ \n Java Collections Framework."
