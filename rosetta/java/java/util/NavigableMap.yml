          notes: "A SortedMap extended with navigation methods returning the\n closest\
            \ matches for given search targets. Methods\n lowerEntry(K), floorEntry(K),\
            \ ceilingEntry(K),\n and higherEntry(K) return Map.Entry objects\n associated\
            \ with keys respectively less than, less than or equal,\n greater than\
            \ or equal, and greater than a given key, returning\n null if there is\
            \ no such key.  Similarly, methods\n lowerKey(K), floorKey(K), ceilingKey(K),\
            \ and\n higherKey(K) return only the associated keys. All of these\n methods\
            \ are designed for locating, not traversing entries.\n\n A NavigableMap\
            \ may be accessed and traversed in either\n ascending or descending key\
            \ order.  The descendingMap()\n method returns a view of the map with\
            \ the senses of all relational\n and directional methods inverted. The\
            \ performance of ascending\n operations and views is likely to be faster\
            \ than that of descending\n ones.  Methods\n subMap(K, boolean, K, boolean),\n\
            \ headMap(K, boolean), and\n tailMap(K, boolean)\n differ from the like-named\
            \ SortedMap methods in accepting\n additional arguments describing whether\
            \ lower and upper bounds are\n inclusive versus exclusive.  Submaps of\
            \ any NavigableMap\n must implement the NavigableMap interface.\n\n This\
            \ interface additionally defines methods firstEntry(),\n pollFirstEntry(),\
            \ lastEntry(), and\n pollLastEntry() that return and/or remove the least\
            \ and\n greatest mappings, if any exist, else returning null.\n\n Implementations\
            \ of entry-returning methods are expected to\n return Map.Entry pairs\
            \ representing snapshots of mappings\n at the time they were produced,\
            \ and thus generally do not\n support the optional Entry.setValue method.\
            \ Note however\n that it is possible to change mappings in the associated\
            \ map using\n method put.\n\n Methods\n subMap(K, K),\n headMap(K), and\n\
            \ tailMap(K)\n are specified to return SortedMap to allow existing\n implementations\
            \ of SortedMap to be compatibly retrofitted to\n implement NavigableMap,\
            \ but extensions and implementations\n of this interface are encouraged\
            \ to override these methods to return\n NavigableMap.  Similarly,\n SortedMap.keySet()\
            \ can be overridden to return NavigableSet.\n\n This interface is a member\
            \ of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
