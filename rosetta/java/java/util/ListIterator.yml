          notes: "An iterator for lists that allows the programmer\n to traverse the\
            \ list in either direction, modify\n the list during iteration, and obtain\
            \ the iterator's\n current position in the list. A ListIterator\n has\
            \ no current element; its cursor position always\n lies between the element\
            \ that would be returned by a call\n to previous() and the element that\
            \ would be\n returned by a call to next().\n An iterator for a list of\
            \ length n has n+1 possible\n cursor positions, as illustrated by the\
            \ carets (^) below:\n \n                      Element(0)   Element(1)\
            \   Element(2)   ... Element(n-1)\n cursor positions:  ^            ^\
            \            ^            ^                  ^\n \n Note that the remove()\
            \ and set(Object) methods are\n not defined in terms of the cursor position;\
            \  they are defined to\n operate on the last element returned by a call\
            \ to next() or\n previous().\n\n This interface is a member of the\n \n\
            \ Java Collections Framework."
