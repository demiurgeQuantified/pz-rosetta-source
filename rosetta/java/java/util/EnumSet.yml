          notes: "A specialized Set implementation for use with enum types.  All of\n\
            \ the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is\n\
            \ specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created.  Enum\
            \ sets\n are represented internally as bit vectors.  This representation\
            \ is\n extremely compact and efficient. The space and time performance\
            \ of this\n class should be good enough to allow its use as a high-quality,\
            \ typesafe\n alternative to traditional int-based \"bit flags.\"  Even\
            \ bulk\n operations (such as containsAll and retainAll) should\n run very\
            \ quickly if their argument is also an enum set.\n\n The iterator returned\
            \ by the iterator method traverses the\n elements in their natural order\
            \ (the order in which the enum\n constants are declared).  The returned\
            \ iterator is weakly\n consistent: it will never throw ConcurrentModificationException\n\
            \ and it may or may not show the effects of any modifications to the set\
            \ that\n occur while the iteration is in progress.\n\n Null elements are\
            \ not permitted.  Attempts to insert a null element\n will throw NullPointerException.\
            \  Attempts to test for the\n presence of a null element or to remove\
            \ one will, however, function\n properly.\n\n Like most collection implementations,\
            \ EnumSet is not\n synchronized.  If multiple threads access an enum set\
            \ concurrently, and at\n least one of the threads modifies the set, it\
            \ should be synchronized\n externally.  This is typically accomplished\
            \ by synchronizing on some\n object that naturally encapsulates the enum\
            \ set.  If no such object exists,\n the set should be \"wrapped\" using\
            \ the Collections.synchronizedSet(java.util.Set<T>)\n method.  This is\
            \ best done at creation time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized access:\n\
            \n \n Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));\n\
            \ \n\n Implementation note: All basic operations execute in constant time.\n\
            \ They are likely (though not guaranteed) to be much faster than their\n\
            \ HashSet counterparts.  Even bulk operations execute in\n constant time\
            \ if their argument is also an enum set.\n\n This class is a member of\
            \ the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
