          notes: "A mutable builder for a Stream.  This allows the creation of a\n\
            \ Stream by generating elements individually and adding them to the\n\
            \ Builder (without the copying overhead that comes from using\n an ArrayList\
            \ as a temporary buffer.)\n\n A stream builder has a lifecycle, which\
            \ starts in a building\n phase, during which elements can be added, and\
            \ then transitions to a built\n phase, after which elements may not be\
            \ added.  The built phase begins\n when the build() method is called,\
            \ which creates an ordered\n Stream whose elements are the elements that\
            \ were added to the stream\n builder, in the order they were added."
