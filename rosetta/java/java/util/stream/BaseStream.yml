          notes: "Base interface for streams, which are sequences of elements supporting\n\
            \ sequential and parallel aggregate operations.  The following example\n\
            \ illustrates an aggregate operation using the stream types Stream\n and\
            \ IntStream, computing the sum of the weights of the red widgets:\n\n\
            \ <code>\n     int sum = widgets.stream()\n                      .filter(w\
            \ -> w.getColor() == RED)\n                      .mapToInt(w -> w.getWeight())\n\
            \                      .sum();\n </code>\n\n See the class documentation\
            \ for Stream and the package documentation\n for java.util.stream for\
            \ additional\n specification of streams, stream operations, stream pipelines,\
            \ and\n parallelism, which governs the behavior of all stream types."

              \  If any close handler throws an exception, the first\n exception thrown\
              \ will be relayed to the caller of close(), with\n any remaining exceptions\
              \ added to that exception as suppressed exceptions\n (unless one of\
