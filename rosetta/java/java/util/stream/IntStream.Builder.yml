          notes: "A mutable builder for an IntStream.\n\n A stream builder has a lifecycle,\
            \ which starts in a building\n phase, during which elements can be added,\
            \ and then transitions to a built\n phase, after which elements may not\
            \ be added.  The built phase\n begins when the build() method is called,\
            \ which creates an\n ordered stream whose elements are the elements that\
            \ were added to the\n stream builder, in the order they were added."
