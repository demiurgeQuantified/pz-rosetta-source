          notes: "The RandomGenerator interface is designed to provide a common\n\
            \ protocol for objects that generate random or (more typically) pseudorandom\n\
            \ sequences of numbers (or Boolean values). Such a sequence may be obtained\
            \ by\n either repeatedly invoking a method that returns a single pseudorandomly\n\
            \ chosen value, or by invoking a method that returns a stream of\n pseudorandomly\
            \ chosen values.\n\n  Ideally, given an implicitly or explicitly specified\
            \ range of values,\n each value would be chosen independently and uniformly\
            \ from that range. In\n practice, one may have to settle for some approximation\
            \ to independence and\n uniformity.\n\n  In the case of int, long, and\
            \ boolean values, if\n there is no explicit specification of range, then\
            \ the range includes all\n possible values of the type. In the case of\
            \ float and double\n values, first a value is always chosen uniformly\
            \ from the set of\n 2w values between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive),\n\
            \ where w is 23 for float values and 52 for double\n values, such that\
            \ adjacent values differ by 2&minus;w\n (notice that this set is a subset\
            \ of the set of\n all representable floating-point values between 0.0\
            \ (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive));\n then if an explicit range was specified,\
            \ then the chosen number is\n computationally scaled and translated so\
            \ as to appear to have been chosen\n approximately uniformly from that\
            \ explicit range.\n\n  Each method that returns a stream produces a stream\
            \ of values each of\n which is chosen in the same manner as for a method\
            \ that returns a single\n pseudorandomly chosen value. For example, if\
            \ r implements\n RandomGenerator, then the method call r.ints(100) returns\
            \ a\n stream of 100 int values. These are not necessarily the exact same\n\
            \ values that would have been returned if instead r.nextInt() had been\n\
            \ called 100 times; all that is guaranteed is that each value in the stream\
            \ is\n chosen in a similar pseudorandom manner from the same range.\n\n\
            \  Every object that implements the RandomGenerator interface by\n using\
            \ a pseudorandom algorithm is assumed to contain a finite amount of\n\
            \ state. Using such an object to generate a pseudorandomly chosen value\
            \ alters\n its state by computing a new state as a function of the current\
            \ state,\n without reference to any information other than the current\
            \ state. The number\n of distinct possible states of such an object is\
            \ called its period.\n (Some implementations of the RandomGenerator interface\
            \ may be truly\n random rather than pseudorandom, for example relying\
            \ on the statistical\n behavior of a physical object to derive chosen\
            \ values. Such implementations\n do not have a fixed period.)\n\n  As\
            \ a rule, objects that implement the RandomGenerator interface\n need\
            \ not be thread-safe. It is recommended that multithreaded applications\n\
            \ use either ThreadLocalRandom or (preferably) pseudorandom number\n generators\
            \ that implement the RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator or\n RandomGenerator.JumpableGenerator\
            \ interface.\n\n  Objects that implement RandomGenerator are typically\
            \ not\n cryptographically secure. Consider instead using SecureRandom\
            \ to get\n a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator for\
            \ use by\n security-sensitive applications. Note, however, that SecureRandom\n\
            \ does implement the RandomGenerator interface, so that instances of\n\
            \ SecureRandom may be used interchangeably with other types of\n pseudorandom\
            \ generators in applications that do not require a secure\n generator.\n\
            \n Unless explicit stated otherwise, the use of null for any method argument\n\
            \ will cause a NullPointerException."
