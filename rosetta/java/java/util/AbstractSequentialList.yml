          notes: "This class provides a skeletal implementation of the List\n interface\
            \ to minimize the effort required to implement this interface\n backed\
            \ by a \"sequential access\" data store (such as a linked list).  For\n\
            \ random access data (such as an array), AbstractList should be used\n\
            \ in preference to this class.\n\n This class is the opposite of the AbstractList\
            \ class in the sense\n that it implements the \"random access\" methods\
            \ (get(int index),\n set(int index, E element), add(int index, E element)\
            \ and\n remove(int index)) on top of the list's list iterator, instead\
            \ of\n the other way around.\n\n To implement a list the programmer needs\
            \ only to extend this class and\n provide implementations for the listIterator\
            \ and size\n methods.  For an unmodifiable list, the programmer need only\
            \ implement the\n list iterator's hasNext, next, hasPrevious,\n previous\
            \ and index methods.\n\n For a modifiable list the programmer should additionally\
            \ implement the list\n iterator's set method.  For a variable-size list\
            \ the programmer\n should additionally implement the list iterator's remove\
            \ and\n add methods.\n\n The programmer should generally provide a void\
            \ (no argument) and collection\n constructor, as per the recommendation\
            \ in the Collection interface\n specification.\n\n This class is a member\
            \ of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
