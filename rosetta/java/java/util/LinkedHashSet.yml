          notes: "Hash table and linked list implementation of the Set interface,\n\
            \ with predictable iteration order.  This implementation differs from\n\
            \ HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through\n\
            \ all of its entries.  This linked list defines the iteration ordering,\n\
            \ which is the order in which elements were inserted into the set\n (insertion-order).\
            \  Note that insertion order is not affected\n if an element is re-inserted\
            \ into the set.  (An element e\n is reinserted into a set s if s.add(e)\
            \ is invoked when\n s.contains(e) would return true immediately prior\
            \ to\n the invocation.)\n\n This implementation spares its clients from\
            \ the unspecified, generally\n chaotic ordering provided by HashSet, without\
            \ incurring the\n increased cost associated with TreeSet.  It can be used\
            \ to\n produce a copy of a set that has the same order as the original,\
            \ regardless\n of the original set's implementation:\n <code>\n     void\
            \ foo(Set<String> s) {\n         Set<String> copy = new LinkedHashSet<>(s);\n\
            \         ...\n     }\n </code>\n This technique is particularly useful\
            \ if a module takes a set on input,\n copies it, and later returns results\
            \ whose order is determined by that of\n the copy.  (Clients generally\
            \ appreciate having things returned in the same\n order they were presented.)\n\
            \n This class provides all of the optional Set operations, and\n permits\
            \ null elements.  Like HashSet, it provides constant-time\n performance\
            \ for the basic operations (add, contains and\n remove), assuming the\
            \ hash function disperses elements\n properly among the buckets.  Performance\
            \ is likely to be just slightly\n below that of HashSet, due to the added\
            \ expense of maintaining the\n linked list, with one exception: Iteration\
            \ over a LinkedHashSet\n requires time proportional to the size of the\
            \ set, regardless of\n its capacity.  Iteration over a HashSet is likely\
            \ to be more\n expensive, requiring time proportional to its capacity.\n\
            \n A linked hash set has two parameters that affect its performance:\n\
            \ initial capacity and load factor.  They are defined precisely\n as for\
            \ HashSet.  Note, however, that the penalty for choosing an\n excessively\
            \ high value for initial capacity is less severe for this class\n than\
            \ for HashSet, as iteration times for this class are unaffected\n by capacity.\n\
            \n Note that this implementation is not synchronized.\n If multiple threads\
            \ access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least\n one of the threads\
            \ modifies the set, it must be synchronized\n externally.  This is typically\
            \ accomplished by synchronizing on some\n object that naturally encapsulates\
            \ the set.\n\n If no such object exists, the set should be \"wrapped\"\
            \ using the\n Collections.synchronizedSet\n method.  This is best done\
            \ at creation time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized access to the\
            \ set: \n   Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashSet(...));\n\
            \n The iterators returned by this class's iterator method are\n fail-fast:\
            \ if the set is modified at any time after the iterator\n is created,\
            \ in any way except through the iterator's own remove\n method, the iterator\
            \ will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\n Thus, in the face of\
            \ concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly\n and cleanly, rather\
            \ than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at\n an undetermined\
            \ time in the future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator\
            \ cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make\
            \ any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.\
            \  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort\
            \ basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended\
            \ on this\n exception for its correctness:   the fail-fast behavior of\
            \ iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n This class is a\
            \ member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
