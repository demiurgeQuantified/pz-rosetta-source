          notes: "Hash table based implementation of the Map interface.  This\n implementation\
            \ provides all of the optional map operations, and permits\n null values\
            \ and the null key.  (The HashMap\n class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable,\
            \ except that it is\n unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes\
            \ no guarantees as to\n the order of the map; in particular, it does not\
            \ guarantee that the order\n will remain constant over time.\n\n This\
            \ implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic\n operations\
            \ (get and put), assuming the hash function\n disperses the elements properly\
            \ among the buckets.  Iteration over\n collection views requires time\
            \ proportional to the \"capacity\" of the\n HashMap instance (the number\
            \ of buckets) plus its size (the number\n of key-value mappings).  Thus,\
            \ it's very important not to set the initial\n capacity too high (or the\
            \ load factor too low) if iteration performance is\n important.\n\n An\
            \ instance of HashMap has two parameters that affect its\n performance:\
            \ initial capacity and load factor.  The\n capacity is the number of buckets\
            \ in the hash table, and the initial\n capacity is simply the capacity\
            \ at the time the hash table is created.  The\n load factor is a measure\
            \ of how full the hash table is allowed to\n get before its capacity is\
            \ automatically increased.  When the number of\n entries in the hash table\
            \ exceeds the product of the load factor and the\n current capacity, the\
            \ hash table is rehashed (that is, internal data\n structures are rebuilt)\
            \ so that the hash table has approximately twice the\n number of buckets.\n\
            \n As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good\n tradeoff\
            \ between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the\n space overhead\
            \ but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of\n the operations\
            \ of the HashMap class, including\n get and put).  The expected number\
            \ of entries in\n the map and its load factor should be taken into account\
            \ when\n setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the number of\n\
            \ rehash operations.  If the initial capacity is greater than the\n maximum\
            \ number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash\n operations\
            \ will ever occur.\n\n If many mappings are to be stored in a HashMap\n\
            \ instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow\n\
            \ the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform\n\
            \ automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.  Note that using\n\
            \ many keys with the same hashCode() is a sure way to slow\n down performance\
            \ of any hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys\n are Comparable,\
            \ this class may use comparison order among\n keys to help break ties.\n\
            \n Note that this implementation is not synchronized.\n If multiple threads\
            \ access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of\n the threads modifies\
            \ the map structurally, it must be\n synchronized externally.  (A structural\
            \ modification is any operation\n that adds or deletes one or more mappings;\
            \ merely changing the value\n associated with a key that an instance already\
            \ contains is not a\n structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished\
            \ by\n synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.\n\
            \n If no such object exists, the map should be \"wrapped\" using the\n\
            \ Collections.synchronizedMap\n method.  This is best done at creation\
            \ time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized access to the map:\n  \
            \ Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));\n\n The iterators\
            \ returned by all of this class's \"collection view methods\"\n are fail-fast:\
            \ if the map is structurally modified at any time after\n the iterator\
            \ is created, in any way except through the iterator's own\n remove method,\
            \ the iterator will throw a\n ConcurrentModificationException.  Thus,\
            \ in the face of concurrent\n modification, the iterator fails quickly\
            \ and cleanly, rather than risking\n arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior\
            \ at an undetermined time in the\n future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking,\
            \ impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized\
            \ concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException\
            \ on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program\
            \ that depended on this\n exception for its correctness: the fail-fast\
            \ behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n This\
            \ class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
