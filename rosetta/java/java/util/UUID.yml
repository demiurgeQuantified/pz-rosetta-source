          notes: "A class that represents an immutable universally unique identifier\
            \ (UUID).\n A UUID represents a 128-bit value.\n\n  There exist different\
            \ variants of these global identifiers.  The methods\n of this class are\
            \ for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the\n constructors\
            \ allow the creation of any variant of UUID (described below).\n\n  The\
            \ layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) UUID is as follows:\n\n The most\
            \ significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:\n \n 0xFFFFFFFF00000000\
            \ time_low\n 0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid\n 0x000000000000F000 version\n\
            \ 0x0000000000000FFF time_hi\n \n The least significant long consists\
            \ of the following unsigned fields:\n \n 0xC000000000000000 variant\n\
            \ 0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq\n 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node\n \n\n  The variant\
            \ field contains a value which identifies the layout of the\n UUID.  The\
            \ bit layout described above is valid only for a \n UUID with a variant\
            \ value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.\n\n  The version\
            \ field holds a value that describes the type of this \n UUID.  There\
            \ are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE\n security,\
            \ name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs.  These types have a\n version\
            \ value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.\n\n  For more information including\
            \ algorithms used to create UUIDs,\n see  RFC 4122: A\n Universally Unique\
            \ IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace, section 4.2\n &quot;Algorithms for\
            \ Creating a Time-Based UUID&quot;."
