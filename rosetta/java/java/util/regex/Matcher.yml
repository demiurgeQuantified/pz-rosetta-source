          notes: "An engine that performs match operations on a character sequence\
            \ by interpreting a Pattern.\n\n  A matcher is created from a pattern\
            \ by invoking the pattern's matcher method.  Once created, a matcher can\
            \ be used to\n perform three different kinds of match operations:\n\n\
            \ \n\n    The matches method attempts to match the entire\n   input sequence\
            \ against the pattern.  \n\n    The lookingAt method attempts to match\
            \ the\n   input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.\
            \  \n\n    The find method scans the input sequence looking\n   for the\
            \ next subsequence that matches the pattern.  \n\n \n\n  Each of these\
            \ methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.\n More information\
            \ about a successful match can be obtained by querying the\n state of\
            \ the matcher.\n\n  A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called\
            \ the\n region. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.\n\
            \ The region can be modified via the region method\n and queried via the\
            \ regionStart and regionEnd methods. The way that the region boundaries\
            \ interact\n with some pattern constructs can be changed. See useAnchoringBounds\
            \ and useTransparentBounds for more details.\n\n  This class also defines\
            \ methods for replacing matched subsequences with\n new strings whose\
            \ contents can, if desired, be computed from the match\n result.  The\
            \ appendReplacement and appendTail methods can be used in tandem in order\
            \ to collect\n the result into an existing string buffer or string builder.\
            \ Alternatively,\n the more convenient replaceAll method can be used to\n\
            \ create a string in which every matching subsequence in the input sequence\n\
            \ is replaced.\n\n  The explicit state of a matcher includes the start\
            \ and end indices of\n the most recent successful match.  It also includes\
            \ the start and end\n indices of the input subsequence captured by each\
            \ capturing group in the pattern as well as a total\n count of such subsequences.\
            \  As a convenience, methods are also provided for\n returning these captured\
            \ subsequences in string form.\n\n  The explicit state of a matcher is\
            \ initially undefined; attempting to\n query any part of it before a successful\
            \ match will cause an IllegalStateException to be thrown.  The explicit\
            \ state of a matcher is\n recomputed by every match operation.\n\n  The\
            \ implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as\n\
            \ well as the append position, which is initially zero and is updated\n\
            \ by the appendReplacement method.\n\n  A matcher may be reset explicitly\
            \ by invoking its reset()\n method or, if a new input sequence is desired,\
            \ its reset(CharSequence) method.  Resetting a\n matcher discards its\
            \ explicit state information and sets the append position\n to zero.\n\
            \n  Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent\n\
            \ threads."
