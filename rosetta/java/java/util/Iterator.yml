          notes: "An iterator over a collection.  Iterator takes the place of\n Enumeration\
            \ in the Java Collections Framework.  Iterators\n differ from enumerations\
            \ in two ways:\n\n \n       Iterators allow the caller to remove elements\
            \ from the\n           underlying collection during the iteration with\
            \ well-defined\n           semantics.\n       Method names have been improved.\n\
            \ \n\n This interface is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework."
