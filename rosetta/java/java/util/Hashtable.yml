          notes: "This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any\n\
            \ non-null object can be used as a key or as a value. \n\n To successfully\
            \ store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the\n objects used as keys\
            \ must implement the hashCode\n method and the equals method. \n\n An\
            \ instance of Hashtable has two parameters that affect its\n performance:\
            \ initial capacity and load factor.  The\n capacity is the number of buckets\
            \ in the hash table, and the\n initial capacity is simply the capacity\
            \ at the time the hash table\n is created.  Note that the hash table is\
            \ open: in the case of a \"hash\n collision\", a single bucket stores\
            \ multiple entries, which must be searched\n sequentially.  The load factor\
            \ is a measure of how full the hash\n table is allowed to get before its\
            \ capacity is automatically increased.\n The initial capacity and load\
            \ factor parameters are merely hints to\n the implementation.  The exact\
            \ details as to when and whether the rehash\n method is invoked are implementation-dependent.\n\
            \n Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between\n\
            \ time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the space overhead but\n\
            \ increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most\n\
            \ Hashtable operations, including get and put).\n\n The initial capacity\
            \ controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the\n need for rehash operations,\
            \ which are time-consuming.\n No rehash operations will ever occur if\
            \ the initial\n capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries\
            \ the\n Hashtable will contain divided by its load factor.  However,\n\
            \ setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.\n\n If many entries\
            \ are to be made into a Hashtable,\n creating it with a sufficiently large\
            \ capacity may allow the\n entries to be inserted more efficiently than\
            \ letting it perform\n automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.\
            \ \n\n This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names\
            \ of\n the numbers as keys:\n    <code>\n   Hashtable<String, Integer>\
            \ numbers\n     = new Hashtable<String, Integer>();\n   numbers.put(\"\
            one\", 1);\n   numbers.put(\"two\", 2);\n   numbers.put(\"three\", 3);</code>\n\
            \n To retrieve a number, use the following code:\n    <code>\n   Integer\
            \ n = numbers.get(\"two\");\n   if (n != null) {\n     System.out.println(\"\
            two = \" + n);\n   }</code>\n\n The iterators returned by the iterator\
            \ method of the collections\n returned by all of this class's \"collection\
            \ view methods\" are\n fail-fast: if the Hashtable is structurally modified\
            \ at any time\n after the iterator is created, in any way except through\
            \ the iterator's own\n remove method, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\
            \  Thus, in the face of concurrent\n modification, the iterator fails\
            \ quickly and cleanly, rather than risking\n arbitrary, non-deterministic\
            \ behavior at an undetermined time in the future.\n The Enumerations returned\
            \ by Hashtable's keys and\n elements methods are not fail-fast; if the\n\
            \ Hashtable is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration\
            \ is\n created then the results of enumerating are undefined.\n\n Note\
            \ that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as\
            \ it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in\
            \ the\n presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast\
            \ iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.\n\
            \ Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this\n\
            \ exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators\n\
            \ should be used only to detect bugs.\n\n As of the Java 2 platform v1.2,\
            \ this class was retrofitted to\n implement the Map interface, making\
            \ it a member of the\n \n\n Java Collections Framework.  Unlike the new\
            \ collection\n implementations, Hashtable is synchronized.  If a\n thread-safe\
            \ implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use\n HashMap in\
            \ place of Hashtable.  If a thread-safe\n highly-concurrent implementation\
            \ is desired, then it is recommended\n to use ConcurrentHashMap in place\
            \ of\n Hashtable."
