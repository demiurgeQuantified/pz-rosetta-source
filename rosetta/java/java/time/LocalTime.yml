          notes: "A time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,\n such\
            \ as 10:15:30.\n \n LocalTime is an immutable date-time object that represents\
            \ a time,\n often viewed as hour-minute-second.\n Time is represented\
            \ to nanosecond precision.\n For example, the value \"13:45.30.123456789\"\
            \ can be stored in a LocalTime.\n \n This class does not store or represent\
            \ a date or time-zone.\n Instead, it is a description of the local time\
            \ as seen on a wall clock.\n It cannot represent an instant on the time-line\
            \ without additional information\n such as an offset or time-zone.\n \n\
            \ The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used\
            \ today\n in most of the world. This API assumes that all calendar systems\
            \ use the same\n representation, this class, for time-of-day.\n \n This\
            \ is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat instances that are\n\
            \ equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances for synchronization,\
            \ or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example, in a future release,\
            \ synchronization may fail.\n The equals method should be used for comparisons."
