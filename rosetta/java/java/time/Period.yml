          notes: "A date-based amount of time in the ISO-8601 calendar system,\n such\
            \ as '2 years, 3 months and 4 days'.\n \n This class models a quantity\
            \ or amount of time in terms of years, months and days.\n See Duration\
            \ for the time-based equivalent to this class.\n \n Durations and periods\
            \ differ in their treatment of daylight savings time\n when added to ZonedDateTime.\
            \ A Duration will add an exact\n number of seconds, thus a duration of\
            \ one day is always exactly 24 hours.\n By contrast, a Period will add\
            \ a conceptual day, trying to maintain\n the local time.\n \n For example,\
            \ consider adding a period of one day and a duration of one day to\n 18:00\
            \ on the evening before a daylight savings gap. The Period will add\n\
            \ the conceptual day and result in a ZonedDateTime at 18:00 the following\
            \ day.\n By contrast, the Duration will add exactly 24 hours, resulting\
            \ in a\n ZonedDateTime at 19:00 the following day (assuming a one hour\
            \ DST gap).\n \n The supported units of a period are YEARS,\n MONTHS and\
            \ DAYS.\n All three fields are always present, but may be set to zero.\n\
            \ \n The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system\
            \ used today\n in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic\
            \ Gregorian calendar\n system, in which today's rules for leap years are\
            \ applied for all time.\n \n The period is modeled as a directed amount\
            \ of time, meaning that individual parts of the\n period may be negative.\n\
            \ \n This is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat instances\
            \ that are\n equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances for\
            \ synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example,\
            \ in a future release, synchronization may fail.\n The equals method should\
            \ be used for comparisons."
