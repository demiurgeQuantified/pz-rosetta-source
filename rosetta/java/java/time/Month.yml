          notes: "A month-of-year, such as 'July'.\n \n Month is an enum representing\
            \ the 12 months of the year -\n January, February, March, April, May,\
            \ June, July, August, September, October,\n November and December.\n \n\
            \ In addition to the textual enum name, each month-of-year has an int\
            \ value.\n The int value follows normal usage and the ISO-8601 standard,\n\
            \ from 1 (January) to 12 (December). It is recommended that applications\
            \ use the enum\n rather than the int value to ensure code clarity.\n \n\
            \ Do not use ordinal() to obtain the numeric representation of Month.\n\
            \ Use getValue() instead.\n \n This enum represents a common concept that\
            \ is found in many calendar systems.\n As such, this enum may be used\
            \ by any calendar system that has the month-of-year\n concept defined\
            \ exactly equivalent to the ISO-8601 calendar system."
