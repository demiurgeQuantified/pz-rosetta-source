          notes: "A time-zone offset from Greenwich/UTC, such as +02:00.\n \n A time-zone\
            \ offset is the amount of time that a time-zone differs from Greenwich/UTC.\n\
            \ This is usually a fixed number of hours and minutes.\n \n Different\
            \ parts of the world have different time-zone offsets.\n The rules for\
            \ how offsets vary by place and time of year are captured in the\n ZoneId\
            \ class.\n \n For example, Paris is one hour ahead of Greenwich/UTC in\
            \ winter and two hours\n ahead in summer. The ZoneId instance for Paris\
            \ will reference two\n ZoneOffset instances - a +01:00 instance for winter,\n\
            \ and a +02:00 instance for summer.\n \n In 2008, time-zone offsets around\
            \ the world extended from -12:00 to +14:00.\n To prevent any problems\
            \ with that range being extended, yet still provide\n validation, the\
            \ range of offsets is restricted to -18:00 to 18:00 inclusive.\n \n This\
            \ class is designed for use with the ISO calendar system.\n The fields\
            \ of hours, minutes and seconds make assumptions that are valid for the\n\
            \ standard ISO definitions of those fields. This class may be used with\
            \ other\n calendar systems providing the definition of the time fields\
            \ matches those\n of the ISO calendar system.\n \n Instances of ZoneOffset\
            \ must be compared using equals(java.lang.Object).\n Implementations may\
            \ choose to cache certain common offsets, however\n applications must\
            \ not rely on such caching.\n \n This is a value-based\n class; programmers\
            \ should treat instances that are\n equal as interchangeable and should\
            \ not\n use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may\n\
            \ occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.\n\
            \ The equals method should be used for comparisons."
