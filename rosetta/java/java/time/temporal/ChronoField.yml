                \ should implement this field as follows.\n If the calendar system\
                \ has only two eras, before and after a fixed date, then the\n proleptic-year\
                \ value must be the same as the year-of-era value for the later era,\n\
                \ and increasingly negative for the earlier era.\n If the calendar\
                \ system has more than two eras, then the proleptic-year value may\
                \ be\n defined with any appropriate value, although defining it to\
                \ be the same as ISO may be\n the best option."

              notes: "The year within the era.\n \n This represents the concept of\
                \ the year within the era.\n This field is typically used with ERA.\n\
                \ \n The standard mental model for a date is based on three concepts\
                \ - year, month and day.\n These map onto the YEAR, MONTH_OF_YEAR\
                \ and DAY_OF_MONTH fields.\n Note that there is no reference to eras.\n\
                \ The full model for a date requires four concepts - era, year, month\
                \ and day. These map onto\n the ERA, YEAR_OF_ERA, MONTH_OF_YEAR and\
                \ DAY_OF_MONTH fields.\n Whether this field or YEAR is used depends\
                \ on which mental model is being used.\n See ChronoLocalDate for more\
                \ discussion on this topic.\n \n In the default ISO calendar system,\
                \ there are two eras defined, 'BCE' and 'CE'.\n The era 'CE' is the\
                \ one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum\
                \ value.\n The era 'BCE' is the previous era, and the year-of-era\
                \ runs backwards.\n \n For example, subtracting a year each time yield\
                \ the following:\n - year-proleptic 2  = 'CE' year-of-era 2\n - year-proleptic\
                \ 1  = 'CE' year-of-era 1\n - year-proleptic 0  = 'BCE' year-of-era\
                \ 1\n - year-proleptic -1 = 'BCE' year-of-era 2\n \n Note that the\
                \ ISO-8601 standard does not actually define eras.\n Note also that\
                \ the ISO eras do not align with the well-known AD/BC eras due to\
                \ the\n change between the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems.\n\
                \ \n Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the\
                \ most recognized\n year-of-era value for users of the calendar system.\n\
                \ Since most calendar systems have only two eras, the year-of-era\
                \ numbering approach\n will typically be the same as that used by\
                \ the ISO calendar system.\n The year-of-era value should typically\
                \ always be positive, however this is not required."
