          notes: "The range of valid values for a date-time field.\n \n All TemporalField\
            \ instances have a valid range of values.\n For example, the ISO day-of-month\
            \ runs from 1 to somewhere between 28 and 31.\n This class captures that\
            \ valid range.\n \n It is important to be aware of the limitations of\
            \ this class.\n Only the minimum and maximum values are provided.\n It\
            \ is possible for there to be invalid values within the outer range.\n\
            \ For example, a weird field may have valid values of 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, thus\n\
            \ have a range of '1 - 7', despite that fact that values 3 and 5 are invalid.\n\
            \ \n Instances of this class are not tied to a specific field."
