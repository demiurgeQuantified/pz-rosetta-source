          notes: "Framework-level interface defining an amount of time, such as\n\
            \ \"6 hours\", \"8 days\" or \"2 years and 3 months\".\n \n This is the\
            \ base interface type for amounts of time.\n An amount is distinct from\
            \ a date or time-of-day in that it is not tied\n to any specific point\
            \ on the time-line.\n \n The amount can be thought of as a Map of TemporalUnit\
            \ to\n long, exposed via getUnits() and get(TemporalUnit).\n A simple\
            \ case might have a single unit-value pair, such as \"6 hours\".\n A more\
            \ complex case may have multiple unit-value pairs, such as\n \"7 years,\
            \ 3 months and 5 days\".\n \n There are two common implementations.\n\
            \ Period is a date-based implementation, storing years, months and days.\n\
            \ Duration is a time-based implementation, storing seconds and nanoseconds,\n\
            \ but providing some access using other duration based units such as minutes,\n\
            \ hours and fixed 24-hour days.\n \n This interface is a framework-level\
            \ interface that should not be widely\n used in application code. Instead,\
            \ applications should create and pass\n around instances of concrete types,\
            \ such as Period and Duration."
