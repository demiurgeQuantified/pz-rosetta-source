          notes: "Strategy for adjusting a temporal object.\n \n Adjusters are a key\
            \ tool for modifying temporal objects.\n They exist to externalize the\
            \ process of adjustment, permitting different\n approaches, as per the\
            \ strategy design pattern.\n Examples might be an adjuster that sets the\
            \ date avoiding weekends, or one that\n sets the date to the last day\
            \ of the month.\n \n There are two equivalent ways of using a TemporalAdjuster.\n\
            \ The first is to invoke the method on this interface directly.\n The\
            \ second is to use Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster):\n \n   // these two\
            \ lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended\n   temporal\
            \ = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);\n   temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);\n\
            \ \n It is recommended to use the second approach, with(TemporalAdjuster),\n\
            \ as it is a lot clearer to read in code.\n \n The TemporalAdjusters class\
            \ contains a standard set of adjusters,\n available as static methods.\n\
            \ These include:\n \n finding the first or last day of the month\n finding\
            \ the first day of next month\n finding the first or last day of the year\n\
            \ finding the first day of next year\n finding the first or last day-of-week\
            \ within a month, such as \"first Wednesday in June\"\n finding the next\
            \ or previous day-of-week, such as \"next Thursday\""
