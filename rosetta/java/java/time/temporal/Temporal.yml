          notes: "Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal\
            \ object,\n such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.\n\
            \ \n This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects\
            \ that\n are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.\n\
            \ It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information\n\
            \ as fields or queries.\n See TemporalAccessor for the read-only version\
            \ of this interface.\n \n Most date and time information can be represented\
            \ as a number.\n These are modeled using TemporalField with the number\
            \ held using\n a long to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month\
            \ are\n simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.\n\
            \ See ChronoField for the standard set of fields.\n \n Two pieces of date/time\
            \ information cannot be represented by numbers,\n the chronology and the\n\
            \ time-zone.\n These can be accessed via queries using\n the static methods\
            \ defined on TemporalQuery.\n \n This interface is a framework-level interface\
            \ that should not be widely\n used in application code. Instead, applications\
            \ should create and pass\n around instances of concrete types, such as\
            \ LocalDate.\n There are many reasons for this, part of which is that\
            \ implementations\n of this interface may be in calendar systems other\
            \ than ISO.\n See ChronoLocalDate for a fuller discussion of the issues.\n\
            \n When to implement\n \n A class should implement this interface if it\
            \ meets three criteria:\n \n it provides access to date/time/offset information,\
            \ as per TemporalAccessor\n the set of fields are contiguous from the\
            \ largest to the smallest\n the set of fields are complete, such that\
            \ no other field is needed to define the\n  valid range of values for\
            \ the fields that are represented\n \n \n Four examples make this clear:\n\
            \ \n LocalDate implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n\
            \  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information\
            \ to determine\n  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement\
            \ plus/minus correctly.\n LocalTime implements this interface as it represents\
            \ a set of fields\n  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and\
            \ require no external information to determine\n  validity. It is able\
            \ to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.\n MonthDay,\
            \ the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement\n\
            \  this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to\
            \ months within years,\n  the combination does not have sufficient information\
            \ to define the valid range of values\n  for day-of-month.  As such, it\
            \ is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.\n The combination day-of-week\
            \ and day-of-month (\"Friday the 13th\") should not implement\n  this\
            \ interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days\
            \ to weeks overlaps\n  days to months."
