          notes: "A unit of date-time, such as Days or Hours.\n \n Measurement of\
            \ time is built on units, such as years, months, days, hours, minutes\
            \ and seconds.\n Implementations of this interface represent those units.\n\
            \ \n An instance of this interface represents the unit itself, rather\
            \ than an amount of the unit.\n See Period for a class that represents\
            \ an amount in terms of the common units.\n \n The most commonly used\
            \ units are defined in ChronoUnit.\n Further units are supplied in IsoFields.\n\
            \ Units can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.\n\
            \ \n The unit works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on\
            \ a date-time like\n LocalDateTime which check if the unit is a ChronoUnit.\n\
            \ If it is, then the date-time must handle it.\n Otherwise, the method\
            \ call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface."

              \ example, this method\n could be used to add \"3 days\" to a date by\

              \ The result will be negative if the end is before the start.\n For\

              \ returns a whole number, representing the number of\n complete units\
              \ between the two temporals.\n For example, the amount in hours between\

              \ made based on which makes the code more readable.\n \n For example,\

              \ \n  long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);\n  // or alternatively\n\
