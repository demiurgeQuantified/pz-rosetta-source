          notes: "Framework-level interface defining read-only access to a temporal\
            \ object,\n such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.\n\
            \ \n This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects.\n\
            \ It is implemented by those classes that can provide information\n as\
            \ fields or queries.\n \n Most date and time information can be represented\
            \ as a number.\n These are modeled using TemporalField with the number\
            \ held using\n a long to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month\
            \ are\n simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.\n\
            \ See ChronoField for the standard set of fields.\n \n Two pieces of date/time\
            \ information cannot be represented by numbers,\n the chronology and the\n\
            \ time-zone.\n These can be accessed via queries using\n the static methods\
            \ defined on TemporalQuery.\n \n A sub-interface, Temporal, extends this\
            \ definition to one that also\n supports adjustment and manipulation on\
            \ more complete temporal objects.\n \n This interface is a framework-level\
            \ interface that should not be widely\n used in application code. Instead,\
            \ applications should create and pass\n around instances of concrete types,\
            \ such as LocalDate.\n There are many reasons for this, part of which\
            \ is that implementations\n of this interface may be in calendar systems\
            \ other than ISO.\n See ChronoLocalDate for a fuller discussion of the\
            \ issues."
