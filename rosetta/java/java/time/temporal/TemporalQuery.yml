          notes: "Strategy for querying a temporal object.\n \n Queries are a key\
            \ tool for extracting information from temporal objects.\n They exist\
            \ to externalize the process of querying, permitting different\n approaches,\
            \ as per the strategy design pattern.\n Examples might be a query that\
            \ checks if the date is the day before February 29th\n in a leap year,\
            \ or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.\n \n The TemporalField\
            \ interface provides another mechanism for querying\n temporal objects.\
            \ That interface is limited to returning a long.\n By contrast, queries\
            \ can return any type.\n \n There are two equivalent ways of using a TemporalQuery.\n\
            \ The first is to invoke the method on this interface directly.\n The\
            \ second is to use TemporalAccessor.query(TemporalQuery):\n \n   // these\
            \ two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended\n \
            \  temporal = thisQuery.queryFrom(temporal);\n   temporal = temporal.query(thisQuery);\n\
            \ \n It is recommended to use the second approach, query(TemporalQuery),\n\
            \ as it is a lot clearer to read in code.\n \n The most common implementations\
            \ are method references, such as\n LocalDate::from and ZoneId::from.\n\
            \ Additional common queries are provided as static methods in TemporalQueries."
