          notes: "A standard set of date periods units.\n \n This set of units provide\
            \ unit-based access to manipulate a date, time or date-time.\n The standard\
            \ set of units can be extended by implementing TemporalUnit.\n \n These\
            \ units are intended to be applicable in multiple calendar systems.\n\
            \ For example, most non-ISO calendar systems define units of years, months\
            \ and days,\n just with slightly different rules.\n The documentation\
            \ of each unit explains how it operates."
