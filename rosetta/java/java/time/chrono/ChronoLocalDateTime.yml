          notes: "A date-time without a time-zone in an arbitrary chronology, intended\n\
            \ for advanced globalization use cases.\n \n Most applications should\
            \ declare method signatures, fields and variables\n as LocalDateTime,\
            \ not this interface.\n \n A ChronoLocalDateTime is the abstract representation\
            \ of a local date-time\n where the Chronology chronology, or calendar\
            \ system, is pluggable.\n The date-time is defined in terms of fields\
            \ expressed by TemporalField,\n where most common implementations are\
            \ defined in ChronoField.\n The chronology defines how the calendar system\
            \ operates and the meaning of\n the standard fields.\n\n When to use this\
            \ interface\n The design of the API encourages the use of LocalDateTime\
            \ rather than this\n interface, even in the case where the application\
            \ needs to deal with multiple\n calendar systems. The rationale for this\
            \ is explored in detail in ChronoLocalDate.\n \n Ensure that the discussion\
            \ in ChronoLocalDate has been read and understood\n before using this\
            \ interface."
