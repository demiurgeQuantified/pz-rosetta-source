          notes: "The ISO calendar system.\n \n This chronology defines the rules\
            \ of the ISO calendar system.\n This calendar system is based on the ISO-8601\
            \ standard, which is the\n de facto world calendar.\n \n The fields are\
            \ defined as follows:\n \n era - There are two eras, 'Current Era' (CE)\
            \ and 'Before Current Era' (BCE).\n year-of-era - The year-of-era is the\
            \ same as the proleptic-year for the current CE era.\n  For the BCE era\
            \ before the ISO epoch the year increases from 1 upwards as time goes\
            \ backwards.\n proleptic-year - The proleptic year is the same as the\
            \ year-of-era for the\n  current era. For the previous era, years have\
            \ zero, then negative values.\n month-of-year - There are 12 months in\
            \ an ISO year, numbered from 1 to 12.\n day-of-month - There are between\
            \ 28 and 31 days in each of the ISO month, numbered from 1 to 31.\n  Months\
            \ 4, 6, 9 and 11 have 30 days, Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 have 31\
            \ days.\n  Month 2 has 28 days, or 29 in a leap year.\n day-of-year -\
            \ There are 365 days in a standard ISO year and 366 in a leap year.\n\
            \  The days are numbered from 1 to 365 or 1 to 366.\n leap-year - Leap\
            \ years occur every 4 years, except where the year is divisble by 100\
            \ and not divisble by 400."
