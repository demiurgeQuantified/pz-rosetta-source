          notes: "A date-based amount of time, such as '3 years, 4 months and 5 days'\
            \ in an\n arbitrary chronology, intended for advanced globalization use\
            \ cases.\n \n This interface models a date-based amount of time in a calendar\
            \ system.\n While most calendar systems use years, months and days, some\
            \ do not.\n Therefore, this interface operates solely in terms of a set\
            \ of supported\n units that are defined by the Chronology.\n The set of\
            \ supported units is fixed for a given chronology.\n The amount of a supported\
            \ unit may be set to zero.\n \n The period is modeled as a directed amount\
            \ of time, meaning that individual\n parts of the period may be negative."
