            notes: "Gets a comparator that compares ChronoLocalDate in\n time-line\
              \ order ignoring the chronology.\n \n This comparator differs from the\
              \ comparison in compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate) in that\
              \ it\n only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.\n This\
              \ allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based\n\
              \ on the position of the date on the local time-line.\n The underlying\
              \ comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day."
