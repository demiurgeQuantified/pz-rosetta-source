          notes: "An era of the time-line.\n \n Most calendar systems have a single\
            \ epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.\n However, some calendar\
            \ systems, have multiple eras, such as one for the reign\n of each leader.\n\
            \ In all cases, the era is conceptually the largest division of the time-line.\n\
            \ Each chronology defines the Era's that are known Eras and a\n Chronology.eras\
            \ to get the valid eras.\n \n For example, the Thai Buddhist calendar\
            \ system divides time into two eras,\n before and after a single date.\
            \ By contrast, the Japanese calendar system\n has one era for the reign\
            \ of each Emperor.\n \n Instances of Era may be compared using the ==\
            \ operator."
