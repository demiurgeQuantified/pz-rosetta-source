          notes: "Enumeration of different ways to resolve dates and times.\n \n Parsing\
            \ a text string occurs in two phases.\n Phase 1 is a basic text parse\
            \ according to the fields added to the builder.\n Phase 2 resolves the\
            \ parsed field-value pairs into date and/or time objects.\n This style\
            \ is used to control how phase 2, resolving, happens."

                \ Individual fields will interpret this differently.\n \n For example,\
                \ lenient mode allows the month in the ISO calendar system\n to be\
                \ outside the range 1 to 12.\n For example, month 15 is treated as\
                \ being 3 months after month 12."

                \ or a third\n behavior. Individual fields will interpret this differently.\n\
                \ \n For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month in the ISO\
                \ calendar\n system using smart mode will ensure that the day-of-month\
                \ is from\n 1 to 31, converting any value beyond the last valid day-of-month\
                \ to be\n the last valid day-of-month."

                \ range of valid values for the field. Individual fields may\n be\
