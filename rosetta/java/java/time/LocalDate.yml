          notes: "A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,\n such\
            \ as 2007-12-03.\n \n LocalDate is an immutable date-time object that\
            \ represents a date,\n often viewed as year-month-day. Other date fields,\
            \ such as day-of-year,\n day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.\n\
            \ For example, the value \"2nd October 2007\" can be stored in a LocalDate.\n\
            \ \n This class does not store or represent a time or time-zone.\n Instead,\
            \ it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays.\n It cannot\
            \ represent an instant on the time-line without additional information\n\
            \ such as an offset or time-zone.\n \n The ISO-8601 calendar system is\
            \ the modern civil calendar system used today\n in most of the world.\
            \ It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n system, in which\
            \ today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.\n For most applications\
            \ written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.\n However,\
            \ any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them\n\
            \ to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.\n \n This\
            \ is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat instances that are\n\
            \ equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances for synchronization,\
            \ or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example, in a future release,\
            \ synchronization may fail.\n The equals method should be used for comparisons."

              \ a leap year if it is divisible by four without\n remainder. However,\
              \ years divisible by 100, are not leap years, with\n the exception of\
              \ years divisible by 400 which are.\n \n For example, 1904 is a leap\
              \ year it is divisible by 4.\n 1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible\
              \ by 100, however 2000 was a\n leap year as it is divisible by 400.\n\
              \ \n The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the\
              \ far future and far past.\n This is historically inaccurate, but is\

              \ \n This returns a LocalDate, based on this one, with the amount\n\
              \ in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount,\
              \ because the\n unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception\
              \ is thrown.\n \n In some cases, adding the amount can cause the resulting\
              \ date to become invalid.\n For example, adding one month to 31st January\
              \ would result in 31st February.\n In cases like this, the unit is responsible\
              \ for resolving the date.\n Typically it will choose the previous valid\
              \ date, which would be the last valid\n day of February in this example.\n\

              \ plusDays(long).\n WEEKS -\n  Returns a LocalDate with the specified\
              \ number of weeks added.\n  This is equivalent to plusWeeks(long) and\
              \ uses a 7 day week.\n MONTHS -\n  Returns a LocalDate with the specified\
              \ number of months added.\n  This is equivalent to plusMonths(long).\n\
              \  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for\
              \ the new\n  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted\
              \ to the maximum\n  valid value for the new month and year.\n YEARS\
              \ -\n  Returns a LocalDate with the specified number of years added.\n\
              \  This is equivalent to plusYears(long).\n  The day-of-month will be\
              \ unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new\n  month and year.\
              \ In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum\n  valid\
              \ value for the new month and year.\n DECADES -\n  Returns a LocalDate\
              \ with the specified number of decades added.\n  This is equivalent\
              \ to calling plusYears(long) with the amount\n  multiplied by 10.\n\
              \  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for\

              \ to the maximum\n  valid value for the new month and year.\n CENTURIES\
              \ -\n  Returns a LocalDate with the specified number of centuries added.\n\
              \  This is equivalent to calling plusYears(long) with the amount\n \
              \ multiplied by 100.\n  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it\
              \ would be invalid for the new\n  month and year. In that case, the\
              \ day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum\n  valid value for the new\
              \ month and year.\n MILLENNIA -\n  Returns a LocalDate with the specified\
              \ number of millennia added.\n  This is equivalent to calling plusYears(long)\
              \ with the amount\n  multiplied by 1,000.\n  The day-of-month will be\
              \ unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new\n  month and year.\
              \ In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum\n  valid\
              \ value for the new month and year.\n ERAS -\n  Returns a LocalDate\
              \ with the specified number of eras added.\n  Only two eras are supported\
              \ so the amount must be one, zero or minus one.\n  If the amount is\
              \ non-zero then the year is changed such that the year-of-era\n  is\
              \ unchanged.\n  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be\
