          notes: "A transition between two offsets caused by a discontinuity in the\
            \ local time-line.\n \n A transition between two offsets is normally the\
            \ result of a daylight savings cutover.\n The discontinuity is normally\
            \ a gap in spring and an overlap in autumn.\n ZoneOffsetTransition models\
            \ the transition between the two offsets.\n \n Gaps occur where there\
            \ are local date-times that simply do not exist.\n An example would be\
            \ when the offset changes from +03:00 to +04:00.\n This might be described\
            \ as 'the clocks will move forward one hour tonight at 1am'.\n \n Overlaps\
            \ occur where there are local date-times that exist twice.\n An example\
            \ would be when the offset changes from +04:00 to +03:00.\n This might\
            \ be described as 'the clocks will move back one hour tonight at 2am'."
