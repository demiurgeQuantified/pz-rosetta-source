          notes: "A DomainCombiner provides a means to dynamically\n update the ProtectionDomains\
            \ associated with the current\n AccessControlContext.\n\n  A DomainCombiner\
            \ is passed as a parameter to the\n appropriate constructor for AccessControlContext.\n\
            \ The newly constructed context is then passed to the\n AccessController.doPrivileged(...,\
            \ context) method\n to bind the provided context (and associated DomainCombiner)\n\
            \ with the current execution Thread.  Subsequent calls to\n AccessController.getContext\
            \ or\n AccessController.checkPermission\n cause the DomainCombiner.combine\
            \ to get invoked.\n\n  The combine method takes two arguments.  The first\
            \ argument represents\n an array of ProtectionDomains from the current\
            \ execution Thread,\n since the most recent call to AccessController.doPrivileged.\n\
            \ If no call to doPrivileged was made, then the first argument will contain\n\
            \ all the ProtectionDomains from the current execution Thread.\n The second\
            \ argument represents an array of inherited ProtectionDomains,\n which\
            \ may be null.  ProtectionDomains may be inherited\n from a parent Thread,\
            \ or from a privileged context.  If no call to\n doPrivileged was made,\
            \ then the second argument will contain the\n ProtectionDomains inherited\
            \ from the parent Thread.  If one or more calls\n to doPrivileged were\
            \ made, and the most recent call was to\n doPrivileged(action, context),\
            \ then the second argument will contain the\n ProtectionDomains from the\
            \ privileged context.  If the most recent call\n was to doPrivileged(action),\
            \ then there is no privileged context,\n and the second argument will\
            \ be null.\n\n  The combine method investigates the two input arrays\n\
            \ of ProtectionDomains and returns a single array containing the updated\n\
            \ ProtectionDomains.  In the simplest case, the combine\n method merges\
            \ the two stacks into one.  In more complex cases,\n the combine method\
            \ returns a modified\n stack of ProtectionDomains.  The modification may\
            \ have added new\n ProtectionDomains, removed certain ProtectionDomains,\
            \ or simply\n updated existing ProtectionDomains.  Re-ordering and other\
            \ optimizations\n to the ProtectionDomains are also permitted.  Typically\
            \ the\n combine method bases its updates on the information\n encapsulated\
            \ in the DomainCombiner.\n\n  After the AccessController.getContext method\n\
            \ receives the combined stack of ProtectionDomains back from\n the DomainCombiner,\
            \ it returns a new\n AccessControlContext that has both the combined ProtectionDomains\n\
            \ as well as the DomainCombiner."
