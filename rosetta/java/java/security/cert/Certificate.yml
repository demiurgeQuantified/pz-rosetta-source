          notes: "Abstract class for managing a variety of identity certificates.\n\
            \ An identity certificate is a binding of a principal to a public key\
            \ which\n is vouched for by another principal.  (A principal represents\n\
            \ an entity such as an individual user, a group, or a corporation.)\n\
            \ \n This class is an abstraction for certificates that have different\n\
            \ formats but important common uses.  For example, different types of\n\
            \ certificates, such as X.509 and PGP, share general certificate\n functionality\
            \ (like encoding and verifying) and\n some types of information (like\
            \ a public key).\n \n X.509, PGP, and SDSI certificates can all be implemented\
            \ by\n subclassing the Certificate class, even though they contain different\n\
            \ sets of information, and they store and retrieve the information in\n\
            \ different ways."
