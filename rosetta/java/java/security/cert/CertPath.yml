          notes: "An immutable sequence of certificates (a certification path).\n\
            \ \n This is an abstract class that defines the methods common to all\n\
            \ CertPaths. Subclasses can handle different kinds of\n certificates (X.509,\
            \ PGP, etc.).\n \n All CertPath objects have a type, a list of\n Certificates,\
            \ and one or more supported encodings. Because the\n CertPath class is\
            \ immutable, a CertPath cannot\n change in any externally visible way\
            \ after being constructed. This\n stipulation applies to all public fields\
            \ and methods of this class and any\n added or overridden by subclasses.\n\
            \ \n The type is a String that identifies the type of\n Certificates in\
            \ the certification path. For each\n certificate cert in a certification\
            \ path certPath,\n cert.getType().equals(certPath.getType()) must be\n\
            \ true.\n \n The list of Certificates is an ordered List of\n zero or\
            \ more Certificates. This List and all\n of the Certificates contained\
            \ in it must be immutable.\n \n Each CertPath object must support one\
            \ or more encodings\n so that the object can be translated into a byte\
            \ array for storage or\n transmission to other parties. Preferably, these\
            \ encodings should be\n well-documented standards (such as PKCS#7). One\
            \ of the encodings supported\n by a CertPath is considered the default\
            \ encoding. This\n encoding is used if no encoding is explicitly requested\
            \ (for the\n getEncoded() method, for instance).\n \n All CertPath objects\
            \ are also Serializable.\n CertPath objects are resolved into an alternate\n\
            \ CertPathRep object during serialization. This allows\n a CertPath object\
            \ to be serialized into an equivalent\n representation regardless of its\
            \ underlying implementation.\n \n CertPath objects can be created with\
            \ a\n CertificateFactory or they can be returned by other classes,\n such\
            \ as a CertPathBuilder.\n \n By convention, X.509 CertPaths (consisting\
            \ of\n X509Certificates), are ordered starting with the target\n certificate\
            \ and ending with a certificate issued by the trust anchor. That\n is,\
            \ the issuer of one certificate is the subject of the following one. The\n\
            \ certificate representing the TrustAnchor should not be\n included in\
            \ the certification path. Unvalidated X.509 CertPaths\n may not follow\
            \ these conventions. PKIX CertPathValidators will\n detect any departure\
            \ from these conventions that cause the certification\n path to be invalid\
            \ and throw a CertPathValidatorException.\n\n  Every implementation of\
            \ the Java platform is required to support the\n following standard CertPath\
            \ encodings:\n \n PKCS7\n PkiPath\n \n These encodings are described in\
            \ the \n CertPath Encodings section of the\n Java Security Standard Algorithm\
            \ Names Specification.\n Consult the release documentation for your implementation\
            \ to see if any\n other encodings are supported.\n \n Concurrent Access\n\
            \ \n All CertPath objects must be thread-safe. That is, multiple\n threads\
            \ may concurrently invoke the methods defined in this class on a\n single\
            \ CertPath object (or more than one) with no\n ill effects. This is also\
            \ true for the List returned by\n CertPath.getCertificates.\n \n Requiring\
            \ CertPath objects to be immutable and thread-safe\n allows them to be\
            \ passed around to various pieces of code without worrying\n about coordinating\
            \ access.  Providing this thread-safety is\n generally not difficult,\
            \ since the CertPath and\n List objects in question are immutable."
