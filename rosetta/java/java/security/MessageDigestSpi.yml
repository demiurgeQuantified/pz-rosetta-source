          notes: "This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI)\n for the\
            \ MessageDigest class, which provides the functionality\n of a message\
            \ digest algorithm, such as MD5 or SHA. Message digests are\n secure one-way\
            \ hash functions that take arbitrary-sized data and output a\n fixed-length\
            \ hash value.\n\n  All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented\
            \ by a\n cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation\n\
            \ of a particular message digest algorithm.\n\n  Implementations are free\
            \ to implement the Cloneable interface."
