          notes: "This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound\n\
            \ properties.  It manages a list of listeners and dispatches\n PropertyChangeEvents\
            \ to them.  You can use an instance of this class\n as a member field\
            \ of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.\n The PropertyChangeListener\
            \ can be registered for all properties\n or for a property specified by\
            \ name.\n \n Here is an example of PropertyChangeSupport usage that follows\n\
            \ the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeans specification:\n\
            \ \n public class MyBean {\n     private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs\
            \ = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);\n\n     public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener\
            \ listener) {\n         this.pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);\n\
            \     }\n\n     public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener\
            \ listener) {\n         this.pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);\n\
            \     }\n\n     private String value;\n\n     public String getValue()\
            \ {\n         return this.value;\n     }\n\n     public void setValue(String\
            \ newValue) {\n         String oldValue = this.value;\n         this.value\
            \ = newValue;\n         this.pcs.firePropertyChange(\"value\", oldValue,\
            \ newValue);\n     }\n\n     [...]\n }\n \n \n A PropertyChangeSupport\
            \ instance is thread-safe.\n \n This class is serializable.  When it is\
            \ serialized it will save\n (and restore) any listeners that are themselves\
            \ serializable.  Any\n non-serializable listeners will be skipped during\
            \ serialization."
