          notes: "The Shape interface provides definitions for objects\n that represent\
            \ some form of geometric shape.  The Shape\n is described by a PathIterator\
            \ object, which can express the\n outline of the Shape as well as a rule\
            \ for determining\n how the outline divides the 2D plane into interior\
            \ and exterior\n points.  Each Shape object provides callbacks to get\
            \ the\n bounding box of the geometry, determine whether points or\n rectangles\
            \ lie partly or entirely within the interior\n of the Shape, and retrieve\
            \ a PathIterator\n object that describes the trajectory path of the Shape\n\
            \ outline.\n \n Definition of insideness:\n A point is considered to lie\
            \ inside a\n Shape if and only if:\n \n  it lies completely\n inside the\
            \ Shape boundary or\n \n it lies exactly on the Shape boundary and the\n\
            \ space immediately adjacent to the\n point in the increasing X direction\
            \ is\n entirely inside the boundary or\n \n it lies exactly on a horizontal\
            \ boundary segment and the\n space immediately adjacent to the point in\
            \ the\n increasing Y direction is inside the boundary.\n \n The contains\
            \ and intersects methods\n consider the interior of a Shape to be the\
            \ area it\n encloses as if it were filled.  This means that these methods\n\
            \ consider\n unclosed shapes to be implicitly closed for the purpose of\n\
            \ determining if a shape contains or intersects a rectangle or if a\n\
