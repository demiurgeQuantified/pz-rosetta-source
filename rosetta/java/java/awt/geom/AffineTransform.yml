          notes: "The AffineTransform class represents a 2D affine transform\n that\
            \ performs a linear mapping from 2D coordinates to other 2D\n coordinates\
            \ that preserves the \"straightness\" and\n \"parallelness\" of lines.\
            \  Affine transformations can be constructed\n using sequences of translations,\
            \ scales, flips, rotations, and shears.\n \n Such a coordinate transformation\
            \ can be represented by a 3 row by\n 3 column matrix with an implied last\
            \ row of [ 0 0 1 ].  This matrix\n transforms source coordinates (x,y)\
            \ into\n destination coordinates (x',y') by considering\n them to be a\
            \ column vector and multiplying the coordinate vector\n by the matrix\
            \ according to the following process:\n \n      [ x']   [  m00  m01  m02\
            \  ] [ x ]   [ m00x + m01y + m02 ]\n      [ y'] = [  m10  m11  m12  ]\
            \ [ y ] = [ m10x + m11y + m12 ]\n      [ 1 ]   [   0    0    1   ] [ 1\
            \ ]   [         1         ]\n \n Handling 90-Degree Rotations\n \n In\
            \ some variations of the rotate methods in the\n AffineTransform class,\
            \ a double-precision argument\n specifies the angle of rotation in radians.\n\
            \ These methods have special handling for rotations of approximately\n\
            \ 90 degrees (including multiples such as 180, 270, and 360 degrees),\n\
            \ so that the common case of quadrant rotation is handled more\n efficiently.\n\
            \ This special handling can cause angles very close to multiples of\n\
            \ 90 degrees to be treated as if they were exact multiples of\n 90 degrees.\n\
            \ For small multiples of 90 degrees the range of angles treated\n as a\
            \ quadrant rotation is approximately 0.00000121 degrees wide.\n This section\
            \ explains why such special care is needed and how\n it is implemented.\n\
            \ \n Since 90 degrees is represented as PI/2 in radians,\n and since PI\
            \ is a transcendental (and therefore irrational) number,\n it is not possible\
            \ to exactly represent a multiple of 90 degrees as\n an exact double precision\
            \ value measured in radians.\n As a result it is theoretically impossible\
            \ to describe quadrant\n rotations (90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees) using\
            \ these values.\n Double precision floating point values can get very\
            \ close to\n non-zero multiples of PI/2 but never close enough\n for the\
            \ sine or cosine to be exactly 0.0, 1.0 or -1.0.\n The implementations\
            \ of Math.sin() and\n Math.cos() correspondingly never return 0.0\n for\
            \ any case other than Math.sin(0.0).\n These same implementations do,\
            \ however, return exactly 1.0 and\n -1.0 for some range of numbers around\
            \ each multiple of 90\n degrees since the correct answer is so close to\
            \ 1.0 or -1.0 that\n the double precision significand cannot represent\
            \ the difference\n as accurately as it can for numbers that are near 0.0.\n\
            \ \n The net result of these issues is that if the\n Math.sin() and Math.cos()\
            \ methods\n are used to directly generate the values for the matrix modifications\n\
            \ during these radian-based rotation operations then the resulting\n transform\
            \ is never strictly classifiable as a quadrant rotation\n even for a simple\
            \ case like rotate(Math.PI/2.0),\n due to minor variations in the matrix\
            \ caused by the non-0.0 values\n obtained for the sine and cosine.\n If\
            \ these transforms are not classified as quadrant rotations then\n subsequent\
            \ code which attempts to optimize further operations based\n upon the\
            \ type of the transform will be relegated to its most general\n implementation.\n\
            \ \n Because quadrant rotations are fairly common,\n this class should\
            \ handle these cases reasonably quickly, both in\n applying the rotations\
            \ to the transform and in applying the resulting\n transform to the coordinates.\n\
            \ To facilitate this optimal handling, the methods which take an angle\n\
            \ of rotation measured in radians attempt to detect angles that are\n\
            \ intended to be quadrant rotations and treat them as such.\n These methods\
            \ therefore treat an angle theta as a quadrant\n rotation if either Math.sin(theta)\
            \ or\n Math.cos(theta) returns exactly 1.0 or -1.0.\n As a rule of thumb,\
            \ this property holds true for a range of\n approximately 0.0000000211\
            \ radians (or 0.00000121 degrees) around\n small multiples of Math.PI/2.0."
