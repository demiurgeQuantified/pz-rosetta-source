          notes: "The GeneralPath class represents a geometric path\n constructed\
            \ from straight lines, and quadratic and cubic\n (B&eacute;zier) curves.\
            \  It can contain multiple subpaths.\n \n GeneralPath is a legacy final\
            \ class which exactly\n implements the behavior of its superclass Path2D.Float.\n\
            \ Together with Path2D.Double, the Path2D classes\n provide full implementations\
            \ of a general geometric path that\n support all of the functionality\
            \ of the Shape and\n PathIterator interfaces with the ability to explicitly\n\
            \ select different levels of internal coordinate precision.\n \n Use Path2D.Float\
            \ (or this legacy GeneralPath\n subclass) when dealing with data that\
            \ can be represented\n and used with floating point precision.  Use Path2D.Double\n\
            \ for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision."
