          notes: "The PathIterator interface provides the mechanism\n for objects\
            \ that implement the Shape\n interface to return the geometry of their\
            \ boundary by allowing\n a caller to retrieve the path of that boundary\
            \ a segment at a\n time.  This interface allows these objects to retrieve\
            \ the path of\n their boundary a segment at a time by using 1st through\
            \ 3rd order\n B&eacute;zier curves, which are lines and quadratic or cubic\n\
            \ B&eacute;zier splines.\n \n Multiple subpaths can be expressed by using\
            \ a \"MOVETO\" segment to\n create a discontinuity in the geometry to\
            \ move from the end of\n one subpath to the beginning of the next.\n \n\
            \ Each subpath can be closed manually by ending the last segment in\n\
            \ the subpath on the same coordinate as the beginning \"MOVETO\" segment\n\
            \ for that subpath or by using a \"CLOSE\" segment to append a line\n\
            \ segment from the last point back to the first.\n Be aware that manually\
            \ closing an outline as opposed to using a\n \"CLOSE\" segment to close\
            \ the path might result in different line\n style decorations being used\
            \ at the end points of the subpath.\n For example, the BasicStroke object\n\
            \ uses a line \"JOIN\" decoration to connect the first and last points\n\
            \ if a \"CLOSE\" segment is encountered, whereas simply ending the path\n\
            \ on the same coordinate as the beginning coordinate results in line\n\
            \ \"CAP\" decorations being used at the ends."
