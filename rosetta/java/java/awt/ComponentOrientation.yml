          notes: "The ComponentOrientation class encapsulates the language-sensitive\n\
            \ orientation that is to be used to order the elements of a component\n\
            \ or of text. It is used to reflect the differences in this ordering\n\
            \ between Western alphabets, Middle Eastern (such as Hebrew), and Far\n\
            \ Eastern (such as Japanese).\n \n Fundamentally, this governs items (such\
            \ as characters) which are laid out\n in lines, with the lines then laid\
            \ out in a block. This also applies\n to items in a widget: for example,\
            \ in a check box where the box is\n positioned relative to the text.\n\
            \ \n There are four different orientations used in modern languages\n\
            \ as in the following table.\n \n LT          RT          TL         \
            \ TR\n A B C       C B A       A D G       G D A\n D E F       F E D \
            \      B E H       H E B\n G H I       I H G       C F I       I F C\n\
            \ \n (In the header, the two-letter abbreviation represents the item direction\n\
            \ in the first letter, and the line direction in the second. For example,\n\
            \ LT means \"items left-to-right, lines top-to-bottom\",\n TL means \"\
            items top-to-bottom, lines left-to-right\", and so on.)\n \n The orientations\
            \ are:\n \n LT - Western Europe (optional for Japanese, Chinese, Korean)\n\
            \ RT - Middle East (Arabic, Hebrew)\n TR - Japanese, Chinese, Korean\n\
            \ TL - Mongolian\n \n Components whose view and controller code depends\
            \ on orientation\n should use the isLeftToRight() and\n isHorizontal()\
            \ methods to\n determine their behavior. They should not include switch-like\n\
            \ code that keys off of the constants, such as:\n \n if (orientation ==\
            \ LEFT_TO_RIGHT) {\n   ...\n } else if (orientation == RIGHT_TO_LEFT)\
            \ {\n   ...\n } else {\n   // Oops\n }\n \n This is unsafe, since more\
            \ constants may be added in the future and\n since it is not guaranteed\
            \ that orientation objects will be unique."
