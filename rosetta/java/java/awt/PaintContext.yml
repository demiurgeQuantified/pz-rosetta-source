          notes: "The PaintContext interface defines the encapsulated\n and optimized\
            \ environment to generate color patterns in device\n space for fill or\
            \ stroke operations on a\n Graphics2D.  The PaintContext provides\n the\
            \ necessary colors for Graphics2D operations in the\n form of a Raster\
            \ associated with a ColorModel.\n The PaintContext maintains state for\
            \ a particular paint\n operation.  In a multi-threaded environment, several\n\
            \ contexts can exist simultaneously for a single Paint object."
