          notes: "This Paint interface defines how color patterns\n can be generated\
            \ for Graphics2D operations.  A class\n implementing the Paint interface\
            \ is added to the\n Graphics2D context in order to define the color\n\
            \ pattern used by the draw and fill methods.\n \n Instances of classes\
            \ implementing Paint must be\n read-only because the Graphics2D does not\
            \ clone\n these objects when they are set as an attribute with the\n setPaint\
            \ method or when the Graphics2D\n object is itself cloned."
