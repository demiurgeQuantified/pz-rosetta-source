            \ For example, the type may affect the kind of\n decorations of a decorated\
            \ Frame or Dialog instance.\n \n Some platforms may not fully support\
            \ a certain window type. Depending on\n the level of support, some properties\
            \ of the window type may be\n disobeyed."
