          notes: "An interface for events that know how to dispatch themselves.\n\
            \ By implementing this interface an event can be placed upon the event\n\
            \ queue and its dispatch() method will be called when the event\n is dispatched,\
            \ using the EventDispatchThread.\n \n This is a very useful mechanism\
            \ for avoiding deadlocks. If\n a thread is executing in a critical section\
            \ (i.e., it has entered\n one or more monitors), calling other synchronized\
            \ code may\n cause deadlocks. To avoid the potential deadlocks, an\n ActiveEvent\
            \ can be created to run the second section of\n code at later time. If\
            \ there is contention on the monitor,\n the second thread will simply\
            \ block until the first thread\n has finished its work and exited its\
            \ monitors.\n \n For security reasons, it is often desirable to use an\
            \ ActiveEvent\n to avoid calling untrusted code from a critical thread.\
            \ For\n instance, peer implementations can use this facility to avoid\n\
            \ making calls into user code from a system thread. Doing so avoids\n\
            \ potential deadlocks and denial-of-service attacks."
