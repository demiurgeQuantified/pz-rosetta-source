          notes: "A container class which implements automatic horizontal and/or\n\
            \ vertical scrolling for a single child component.  The display\n policy\
            \ for the scrollbars can be set to:\n \n as needed: scrollbars created\
            \ and shown only when needed by scrollpane\n always: scrollbars created\
            \ and always shown by the scrollpane\n never: scrollbars never created\
            \ or shown by the scrollpane\n \n \n The state of the horizontal and vertical\
            \ scrollbars is represented\n by two ScrollPaneAdjustable objects (one\
            \ for each\n dimension) which implement the Adjustable interface.\n The\
            \ API provides methods to access those objects such that the\n attributes\
            \ on the Adjustable object (such as unitIncrement, value,\n etc.) can\
            \ be manipulated.\n \n Certain adjustable properties (minimum, maximum,\
            \ blockIncrement,\n and visibleAmount) are set internally by the scrollpane\
            \ in accordance\n with the geometry of the scrollpane and its child and\
            \ these should\n not be set by programs using the scrollpane.\n \n If\
            \ the scrollbar display policy is defined as \"never\", then the\n scrollpane\
            \ can still be programmatically scrolled using the\n setScrollPosition()\
            \ method and the scrollpane will move and clip\n the child's contents\
            \ appropriately.  This policy is useful if the\n program needs to create\
            \ and manage its own adjustable controls.\n \n The placement of the scrollbars\
            \ is controlled by platform-specific\n properties set by the user outside\
            \ of the program.\n \n The initial size of this container is set to 100x100,\
            \ but can\n be reset using setSize().\n \n Scrolling with the wheel on\
            \ a wheel-equipped mouse is enabled by default.\n This can be disabled\
            \ using setWheelScrollingEnabled.\n Wheel scrolling can be customized\
            \ by setting the block and\n unit increment of the horizontal and vertical\
            \ Adjustables.\n For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched,\
            \ see\n the class description for MouseWheelEvent.\n \n Insets are used\
            \ to define any space used by scrollbars and any\n borders created by\
            \ the scroll pane. getInsets() can be used\n to get the current value\
            \ for the insets.  If the value of\n scrollbarsAlwaysVisible is false,\
            \ then the value of the insets\n will change dynamically depending on\
            \ whether the scrollbars are\n currently visible or not."
