          notes: "The Stroke interface allows a\n Graphics2D object to obtain a Shape\
            \ that is the\n decorated outline, or stylistic representation of the\
            \ outline,\n of the specified Shape.\n Stroking a Shape is like tracing\
            \ its outline with a\n marking pen of the appropriate size and shape.\n\
            \ The area where the pen would place ink is the area enclosed by the\n\
            \ outline Shape.\n \n The methods of the Graphics2D interface that use\
            \ the\n outline Shape returned by a Stroke object\n include draw and any\
            \ other methods that are\n implemented in terms of that method, such as\n\
            \ drawLine, drawRect,\n drawRoundRect, drawOval,\n drawArc, drawPolyline,\n\
            \ and drawPolygon.\n \n The objects of the classes implementing Stroke\n\
            \ must be read-only because Graphics2D does not\n clone these objects\
            \ either when they are set as an attribute\n with the setStroke method\
            \ or when the\n Graphics2D object is itself cloned.\n If a Stroke object\
            \ is modified after it is set in\n the Graphics2D context then the behavior\n\
            \ of subsequent rendering would be undefined."
