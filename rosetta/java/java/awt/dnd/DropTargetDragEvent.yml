            \ its\n dragEnter() and dragOver() methods.\n \n The DropTargetDragEvent\
            \ reports the source drop actions\n and the user drop action that reflect\
            \ the current state of\n the drag operation.\n \n Source drop actions\
            \ is a bitwise mask of DnDConstants\n that represents the set of drop\
            \ actions supported by the drag source for\n this drag operation.\n \n\
            \ User drop action depends on the drop actions supported by the drag\n\
            \ source and the drop action selected by the user. The user can select\
            \ a drop\n action by pressing modifier keys during the drag operation:\n\
            \ \n   Ctrl + Shift -> ACTION_LINK\n   Ctrl         -> ACTION_COPY\n \
            \  Shift        -> ACTION_MOVE\n \n If the user selects a drop action,\
            \ the user drop action is one of\n DnDConstants that represents the selected\
            \ drop action if this\n drop action is supported by the drag source or\n\
            \ DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE if this drop action is not supported\n by the\
            \ drag source.\n \n If the user doesn't select a drop action, the set\
            \ of\n DnDConstants that represents the set of drop actions supported\n\
            \ by the drag source is searched for DnDConstants.ACTION_MOVE,\n then\
            \ for DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY, then for\n DnDConstants.ACTION_LINK and\
            \ the user drop action is the\n first constant found. If no constant is\
            \ found the user drop action\n is DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE."
