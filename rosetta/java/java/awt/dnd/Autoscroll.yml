          notes: "During DnD operations it is possible that a user may wish to drop\
            \ the\n subject of the operation on a region of a scrollable GUI control\
            \ that is\n not currently visible to the user.\n \n In such situations\
            \ it is desirable that the GUI control detect this\n and institute a scroll\
            \ operation in order to make obscured region(s)\n visible to the user.\
            \ This feature is known as autoscrolling.\n \n If a GUI control is both\
            \ an active DropTarget\n and is also scrollable, it\n can receive notifications\
            \ of autoscrolling gestures by the user from\n the DnD system by implementing\
            \ this interface.\n \n An autoscrolling gesture is initiated by the user\
            \ by keeping the drag\n cursor motionless with a border region of the\
            \ Component,\n referred to as\n the \"autoscrolling region\", for a predefined\
            \ period of time, this will\n result in repeated scroll requests to the\
            \ Component\n until the drag Cursor resumes its motion."

            notes: "This method returns the Insets describing\n the autoscrolling\
              \ region or border relative\n to the geometry of the implementing Component.\n\
              \ \n This value is read once by the DropTarget\n upon entry of the drag\
              \ Cursor\n into the associated Component."
