            \ and to\n provide appropriate &quot;drag over&quot;\n feedback to the\
            \ user throughout the\n Drag and Drop operation.\n \n The drop site is\
            \ associated with the previous dragEnter()\n invocation if the latest\
            \ invocation of dragEnter() on this\n listener:\n \n corresponds to that\
            \ drop site and\n  is not followed by a dragExit() invocation on this\
