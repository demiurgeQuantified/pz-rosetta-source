          notes: "The DragGestureRecognizer is an\n abstract base class for the specification\n\
            \ of a platform-dependent listener that can be associated with a particular\n\
            \ Component in order to\n identify platform-dependent drag initiating\
            \ gestures.\n \n The appropriate DragGestureRecognizer\n subclass instance\
            \ is obtained from the\n DragSource associated with\n a particular Component,\
            \ or from the Toolkit object via its\n createDragGestureRecognizer()\n\
            \ method.\n \n Once the DragGestureRecognizer\n is associated with a particular\
            \ Component\n it will register the appropriate listener interfaces on\
            \ that\n Component\n in order to track the input events delivered to the\
            \ Component.\n \n Once the DragGestureRecognizer identifies a sequence\
            \ of events\n on the Component as a drag initiating gesture, it will notify\n\
            \ its unicast DragGestureListener by\n invoking its\n gestureRecognized()\n\
            \ method.\n \n When a concrete DragGestureRecognizer\n instance detects\
            \ a drag initiating\n gesture on the Component it is associated with,\n\
            \ it fires a DragGestureEvent to\n the DragGestureListener registered\
            \ on\n its unicast event source for DragGestureListener\n events. This\
            \ DragGestureListener is responsible\n for causing the associated\n DragSource\
            \ to start the Drag and Drop operation (if\n appropriate)."
