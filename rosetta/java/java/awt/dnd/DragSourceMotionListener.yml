            \ drag\n operation.\n \n The class that is interested in processing mouse\
            \ motion events during\n a drag operation either implements this interface\
            \ or extends the abstract\n DragSourceAdapter class (overriding only the\
            \ methods of\n interest).\n \n Create a listener object using that class\
            \ and then register it with\n a DragSource. Whenever the mouse moves during\
            \ a drag\n operation initiated with this DragSource, that object's\n dragMouseMoved\
            \ method is invoked, and the\n DragSourceDragEvent is passed to it."
