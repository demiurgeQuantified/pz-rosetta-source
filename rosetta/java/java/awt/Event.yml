          notes: "NOTE: The Event class is obsolete and is\n available only for backwards\
            \ compatibility.  It has been replaced\n by the AWTEvent class and its\
            \ subclasses.\n \n Event is a platform-independent class that\n encapsulates\
            \ events from the platform's Graphical User\n Interface in the Java 1.0\
            \ event model. In Java 1.1\n and later versions, the Event class is maintained\n\
            \ only for backwards compatibility. The information in this\n class description\
            \ is provided to assist programmers in\n converting Java 1.0 programs\
            \ to the new event model.\n \n In the Java 1.0 event model, an event contains\
            \ an\n id field\n that indicates what type of event it is and which other\n\
            \ Event variables are relevant for the event.\n \n For keyboard events,\
            \ key\n contains a value indicating which key was activated, and\n modifiers\
            \ contains the\n modifiers for that event.  For the KEY_PRESS and KEY_RELEASE\n\
            \ event ids, the value of key is the unicode\n character code for the\
            \ key. For KEY_ACTION and\n KEY_ACTION_RELEASE, the value of key is\n\
            \ one of the defined action-key identifiers in the\n Event class (PGUP,\n\
            \ PGDN, F1, F2, etc)."
