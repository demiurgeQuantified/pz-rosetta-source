            notes: "Invoked when the application is asked to quit.\n \n Implementors\
              \ must call either QuitResponse.cancelQuit(),\n QuitResponse.performQuit(),\
              \ or ensure the application terminates.\n The process (or log-out) requesting\
              \ this app to quit will be blocked\n until the QuitResponse is handled.\
              \ Apps that require complex UI\n to shutdown may call the QuitResponse\
              \ from any thread. Your app\n may be asked to quit multiple times before\
              \ you have responded to the\n initial request. This handler is called\
              \ each time a quit is requested,\n and the same QuitResponse object\
              \ is passed until it is handled.\n Once used, the QuitResponse cannot\
              \ be used again to change the\n decision."
