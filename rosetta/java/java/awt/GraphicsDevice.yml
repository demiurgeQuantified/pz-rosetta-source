          notes: "The GraphicsDevice class describes the graphics devices\n that might\
            \ be available in a particular graphics environment.  These\n include\
            \ screen and printer devices. Note that there can be many screens\n and\
            \ many printers in an instance of GraphicsEnvironment. Each\n graphics\
            \ device has one or more GraphicsConfiguration objects\n associated with\
            \ it.  These objects specify the different configurations\n in which the\
            \ GraphicsDevice can be used.\n \n In a multi-screen environment, the\
            \ GraphicsConfiguration\n objects can be used to render components on\
            \ multiple screens.  The\n following code sample demonstrates how to create\
            \ a JFrame\n object for each GraphicsConfiguration on each screen\n device\
            \ in the GraphicsEnvironment:\n <code>\n   GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.\n\
            \   getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();\n   GraphicsDevice[] gs = ge.getScreenDevices();\n\
            \   for (int j = 0; j < gs.length; j++) {\n      GraphicsDevice gd = gs[j];\n\
            \      GraphicsConfiguration[] gc =\n      gd.getConfigurations();\n \
            \     for (int i=0; i < gc.length; i++) {\n         JFrame f = new\n \
            \        JFrame(gs[j].getDefaultConfiguration());\n         Canvas c =\
            \ new Canvas(gc[i]);\n         Rectangle gcBounds = gc[i].getBounds();\n\
            \         int xoffs = gcBounds.x;\n         int yoffs = gcBounds.y;\n\
            \         f.getContentPane().add(c);\n         f.setLocation((i*50)+xoffs,\
            \ (i*60)+yoffs);\n         f.show();\n      }\n   }\n </code>\n \n For\
            \ more information on full-screen exclusive mode API, see the\n \n Full-Screen\
            \ Exclusive Mode API Tutorial."

              \ closely to the desktop settings.\n \n When entering full-screen mode,\
              \ if the window to be used as a\n full-screen window is not visible,\

              \ to windowed mode.\n \n When entering full-screen mode, all the translucency\
              \ effects are reset for\n the window. Its shape is set to null, the\
              \ opacity value is set to\n 1.0f, and the background color alpha is\
              \ set to 255 (completely opaque).\n These values are not restored when\
              \ returning to windowed mode.\n \n It is unspecified and platform-dependent\
              \ how decorated windows operate\n in full-screen mode. For this reason,\
              \ it is recommended to turn off\n the decorations in a Frame or Dialog\
              \ object by using the\n setUndecorated method.\n \n When returning to\
              \ windowed mode from an exclusive full-screen window,\n any display\
