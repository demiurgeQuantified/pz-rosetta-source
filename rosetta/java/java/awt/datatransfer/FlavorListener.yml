            notes: "Invoked when the target Clipboard of the listener has changed\
              \ its\n available DataFlavors.\n \n Some notifications may be redundant\
              \ &#8212; they are not caused by a\n change of the set of DataFlavors\
              \ available on the clipboard. For example,\n if the clipboard subsystem\
              \ supposes that the system clipboard's contents\n has been changed but\
              \ it can't ascertain whether its DataFlavors have been\n changed because\
              \ of some exceptional condition when accessing the\n clipboard, the\
              \ notification is sent to ensure from omitting a significant\n notification.\
              \ Ordinarily, those redundant notifications should be\n occasional."
