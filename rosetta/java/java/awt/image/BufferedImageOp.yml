          notes: "This interface describes single-input/single-output\n operations\
            \ performed on BufferedImage objects.\n It is implemented by AffineTransformOp,\n\
            \ ConvolveOp, ColorConvertOp, RescaleOp,\n and LookupOp.  These objects\
            \ can be passed into\n a BufferedImageFilter to operate on a\n BufferedImage\
            \ in the\n ImageProducer-ImageFilter-ImageConsumer paradigm.\n \n Classes\
            \ that implement this\n interface must specify whether or not they allow\
            \ in-place filtering--\n filter operations where the source object is\
            \ equal to the destination\n object.\n \n This interface cannot be used\
            \ to describe more sophisticated operations\n such as those that take\
            \ multiple sources. Note that this restriction also\n means that the values\
            \ of the destination pixels prior to the operation are\n not used as input\
            \ to the filter operation."
