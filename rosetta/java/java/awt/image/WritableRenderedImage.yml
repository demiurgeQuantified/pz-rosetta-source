          notes: "WritableRenderedImage is a common interface for objects which\n\
            \ contain or can produce image data in the form of Rasters and\n which\
            \ can be modified and/or written over.  The image\n data may be stored/produced\
            \ as a single tile or a regular array\n of tiles.\n \n WritableRenderedImage\
            \ provides notification to other interested\n objects when a tile is checked\
            \ out for writing (via the\n getWritableTile method) and when the last\
            \ writer of a particular\n tile relinquishes its access (via a call to\
            \ releaseWritableTile).\n Additionally, it allows any caller to determine\
            \ whether any tiles\n are currently checked out (via hasTileWriters),\
            \ and to obtain a\n list of such tiles (via getWritableTileIndices, in\
            \ the form of a Vector\n of Point objects).\n \n Objects wishing to be\
            \ notified of changes in tile writability must\n implement the TileObserver\
            \ interface, and are added by a\n call to addTileObserver.  Multiple calls\
            \ to\n addTileObserver for the same object will result in multiple\n notifications.\
            \  An existing observer may reduce its notifications\n by calling removeTileObserver;\
            \ if the observer had no\n notifications the operation is a no-op.\n \n\
            \ It is necessary for a WritableRenderedImage to ensure that\n notifications\
            \ occur only when the first writer acquires a tile and\n the last writer\
            \ releases it."
