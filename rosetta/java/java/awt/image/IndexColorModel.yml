          notes: "The IndexColorModel class is a ColorModel\n class that works with\
            \ pixel values consisting of a\n single sample that is an index into a\
            \ fixed colormap in the default\n sRGB color space.  The colormap specifies\
            \ red, green, blue, and\n optional alpha components corresponding to each\
            \ index.  All components\n are represented in the colormap as 8-bit unsigned\
            \ integral values.\n Some constructors allow the caller to specify \"\
            holes\" in the colormap\n by indicating which colormap entries are valid\
            \ and which represent\n unusable colors via the bits set in a BigInteger\
            \ object.\n This color model is similar to an X11 PseudoColor visual.\n\
            \ \n Some constructors provide a means to specify an alpha component\n\
            \ for each pixel in the colormap, while others either provide no\n such\
            \ means or, in some cases, a flag to indicate whether the\n colormap data\
            \ contains alpha values.  If no alpha is supplied to\n the constructor,\
            \ an opaque alpha component (alpha = 1.0) is\n assumed for each entry.\n\
            \ An optional transparent pixel value can be supplied that indicates a\n\
            \ pixel to be made completely transparent, regardless of any alpha\n component\
            \ supplied or assumed for that pixel value.\n Note that the color components\
            \ in the colormap of an\n IndexColorModel objects are never pre-multiplied\
            \ with\n the alpha components.\n \n \n The transparency of an IndexColorModel\
            \ object is\n determined by examining the alpha components of the colors\
            \ in the\n colormap and choosing the most specific value after considering\n\
            \ the optional alpha values and any transparent index specified.\n The\
            \ transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE\n only if all valid colors\
            \ in\n the colormap are opaque and there is no valid transparent pixel.\n\
            \ If all valid colors\n in the colormap are either completely opaque (alpha\
            \ = 1.0) or\n completely transparent (alpha = 0.0), which typically occurs\
            \ when\n a valid transparent pixel is specified,\n the value is Transparency.BITMASK.\n\
            \ Otherwise, the value is Transparency.TRANSLUCENT, indicating\n that\
            \ some valid color has an alpha component that is\n neither completely\
            \ transparent nor completely opaque\n (0.0 < alpha < 1.0).\n \n\n \n If\
            \ an IndexColorModel object has\n a transparency value of Transparency.OPAQUE,\n\
            \ then the hasAlpha\n and getNumComponents methods\n (both inherited from\
            \ ColorModel)\n return false and 3, respectively.\n For any other transparency\
            \ value,\n hasAlpha returns true\n and getNumComponents returns 4.\n\n\
            \ \n \n The values used to index into the colormap are taken from the\
            \ least\n significant n bits of pixel representations where\n n is based\
            \ on the pixel size specified in the constructor.\n For pixel sizes smaller\
            \ than 8 bits, n is rounded up to a\n power of two (3 becomes 4 and 5,6,7\
            \ become 8).\n For pixel sizes between 8 and 16 bits, n is equal to the\n\
            \ pixel size.\n Pixel sizes larger than 16 bits are not supported by this\
            \ class.\n Higher order bits beyond n are ignored in pixel representations.\n\
            \ Index values greater than or equal to the map size, but less than\n\
            \ 2n, are undefined and return 0 for all color and\n alpha components.\n\
            \ \n \n For those methods that use a primitive array pixel representation\
            \ of\n type transferType, the array length is always one.\n The transfer\
            \ types supported are DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE and\n DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT.\
            \  A single int pixel\n representation is valid for all objects of this\
            \ class, since it is\n always possible to represent pixel values used\
            \ with this class in a\n single int.  Therefore, methods that use this\
            \ representation do\n not throw an IllegalArgumentException due to an\
            \ invalid\n pixel value.\n \n Many of the methods in this class are final.\
            \  The reason for\n this is that the underlying native graphics code makes\
            \ assumptions\n about the layout and operation of this class and those\
            \ assumptions\n are reflected in the implementations of the methods here\
            \ that are\n marked final.  You can subclass this class for other reasons,\
            \ but\n you cannot override or modify the behaviour of those methods."
