          notes: "A RenderContext encapsulates the information needed to produce a\n\
            \ specific rendering from a RenderableImage.  It contains the area to\n\
            \ be rendered specified in rendering-independent terms, the\n resolution\
            \ at which the rendering is to be performed, and hints\n used to control\
            \ the rendering process.\n\n  Users create RenderContexts and pass them\
            \ to the\n RenderableImage via the createRendering method.  Most of the\
            \ methods of\n RenderContexts are not meant to be used directly by applications,\n\
            \ but by the RenderableImage and operator classes to which it is\n passed.\n\
            \n  The AffineTransform parameter passed into and out of this class\n\
            \ are cloned.  The RenderingHints and Shape parameters are not\n necessarily\
            \ cloneable and are therefore only reference copied.\n Altering RenderingHints\
            \ or Shape instances that are in use by\n instances of RenderContext may\
            \ have undesired side effects."
