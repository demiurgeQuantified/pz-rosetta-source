          notes: "A RenderableImage is a common interface for rendering-independent\n\
            \ images (a notion which subsumes resolution independence).  That is,\n\
            \ images which are described and have operations applied to them\n independent\
            \ of any specific rendering of the image.  For example, a\n RenderableImage\
            \ can be rotated and cropped in\n resolution-independent terms.  Then,\
            \ it can be rendered for various\n specific contexts, such as a draft\
            \ preview, a high-quality screen\n display, or a printer, each in an optimal\
            \ fashion.\n\n  A RenderedImage is returned from a RenderableImage via\
            \ the\n createRendering() method, which takes a RenderContext.  The\n\
            \ RenderContext specifies how the RenderedImage should be\n constructed.\
            \  Note that it is not possible to extract pixels\n directly from a RenderableImage.\n\
            \n  The createDefaultRendering() and createScaledRendering() methods are\n\
            \ convenience methods that construct an appropriate RenderContext\n internally.\
            \  All of the rendering methods may return a reference to a\n previously\
            \ produced rendering."
