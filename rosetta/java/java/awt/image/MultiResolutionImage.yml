          notes: "This interface is designed to be an optional additional API supported\
            \ by\n some implementations of Image to allow them to provide\n alternate\
            \ images for various rendering resolutions. The various\n Graphics.drawImage(...)\
            \ variant methods will consult the methods\n of this interface if it is\
            \ implemented on the argument Image object\n in order to choose the best\
            \ representation to use for each rendering operation.\n \n The MultiResolutionImage\
            \ interface should be implemented by any\n subclass of java.awt.Image\
            \ whose instances are intended to provide\n image resolution variants\
            \ according to the given image width and height.\n For convenience, toolkit\
            \ images obtained from\n Toolkit.getImage(String name) and Toolkit.getImage(URL\
            \ url)\n will implement this interface on platforms that support naming\
            \ conventions\n for resolution variants of stored image media and the\n\
            \ AbstractMultiResolutionImage and BaseMultiResolutionImage\n classes\
            \ are provided to facilitate easy construction of custom multi-resolution\n\
            \ images from a list of related images."
