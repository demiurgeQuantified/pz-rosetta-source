          notes: "This abstract class defines an interface for extracting samples\
            \ of pixels\n  in an image.  All image data is expressed as a collection\
            \ of pixels.\n  Each pixel consists of a number of samples. A sample is\
            \ a datum\n  for one band of an image and a band consists of all samples\
            \ of a\n  particular type in an image.  For example, a pixel might contain\n\
            \  three samples representing its red, green and blue components.\n  There\
            \ are three bands in the image containing this pixel.  One band\n  consists\
            \ of all the red samples from all pixels in the\n  image.  The second\
            \ band consists of all the green samples and\n  the remaining band consists\
            \ of all of the blue samples.  The pixel\n  can be stored in various formats.\
            \  For example, all samples from\n  a particular band can be stored contiguously\
            \ or all samples from a\n  single pixel can be stored contiguously.\n\
            \  \n  Subclasses of SampleModel specify the types of samples they can\n\
            \  represent (e.g. unsigned 8-bit byte, signed 16-bit short, etc.)\n \
            \ and may specify how the samples are organized in memory.\n  In the Java\
            \ 2D(tm) API, built-in image processing operators may\n  not operate on\
            \ all possible sample types, but generally will work\n  for unsigned integral\
            \ samples of 16 bits or less.  Some operators\n  support a wider variety\
            \ of sample types.\n  \n  A collection of pixels is represented as a Raster,\
            \ which consists of\n  a DataBuffer and a SampleModel.  The SampleModel\
            \ allows access to\n  samples in the DataBuffer and may provide low-level\
            \ information that\n  a programmer can use to directly manipulate samples\
            \ and pixels in the\n  DataBuffer.\n  \n  This class is generally a fall\
            \ back method for dealing with\n  images.  More efficient code will cast\
            \ the SampleModel to the\n  appropriate subclass and extract the information\
            \ needed to directly\n  manipulate pixels in the DataBuffer."
