          notes: "A class representing a rectangular array of pixels.  A Raster\n\
            \ encapsulates a DataBuffer that stores the sample values and a\n SampleModel\
            \ that describes how to locate a given sample value in a\n DataBuffer.\n\
            \ \n A Raster defines values for pixels occupying a particular\n rectangular\
            \ area of the plane, not necessarily including (0, 0).\n The rectangle,\
            \ known as the Raster's bounding rectangle and\n available by means of\
            \ the getBounds method, is defined by minX,\n minY, width, and height\
            \ values.  The minX and minY values define\n the coordinate of the upper\
            \ left corner of the Raster.  References\n to pixels outside of the bounding\
            \ rectangle may result in an\n exception being thrown, or may result in\
            \ references to unintended\n elements of the Raster's associated DataBuffer.\
            \  It is the user's\n responsibility to avoid accessing such pixels.\n\
            \ \n A SampleModel describes how samples of a Raster\n are stored in the\
            \ primitive array elements of a DataBuffer.\n Samples may be stored one\
            \ per data element, as in a\n PixelInterleavedSampleModel or BandedSampleModel,\
            \ or packed several to\n an element, as in a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel\
            \ or\n MultiPixelPackedSampleModel.  The SampleModel is also\n controls\
            \ whether samples are sign extended, allowing unsigned\n data to be stored\
            \ in signed Java data types such as byte, short, and\n int.\n \n Although\
            \ a Raster may live anywhere in the plane, a SampleModel\n makes use of\
            \ a simple coordinate system that starts at (0, 0).  A\n Raster therefore\
            \ contains a translation factor that allows pixel\n locations to be mapped\
            \ between the Raster's coordinate system and\n that of the SampleModel.\
            \  The translation from the SampleModel\n coordinate system to that of\
            \ the Raster may be obtained by the\n getSampleModelTranslateX and getSampleModelTranslateY\
            \ methods.\n \n A Raster may share a DataBuffer with another Raster either\
            \ by\n explicit construction or by the use of the createChild and\n createTranslatedChild\
            \ methods.  Rasters created by these methods\n can return a reference\
            \ to the Raster they were created from by\n means of the getParent method.\
            \  For a Raster that was not\n constructed by means of a call to createTranslatedChild\
            \ or\n createChild, getParent will return null.\n \n The createTranslatedChild\
            \ method returns a new Raster that\n shares all of the data of the current\
            \ Raster, but occupies a\n bounding rectangle of the same width and height\
            \ but with a\n different starting point.  For example, if the parent Raster\n\
            \ occupied the region (10, 10) to (100, 100), and the translated\n Raster\
            \ was defined to start at (50, 50), then pixel (20, 20) of the\n parent\
            \ and pixel (60, 60) of the child occupy the same location in\n the DataBuffer\
            \ shared by the two Rasters.  In the first case, (-10,\n -10) should be\
            \ added to a pixel coordinate to obtain the\n corresponding SampleModel\
            \ coordinate, and in the second case (-50,\n -50) should be added.\n \n\
            \ The translation between a parent and child Raster may be\n determined\
            \ by subtracting the child's sampleModelTranslateX and\n sampleModelTranslateY\
            \ values from those of the parent.\n \n The createChild method may be\
            \ used to create a new Raster\n occupying only a subset of its parent's\
            \ bounding rectangle\n (with the same or a translated coordinate system)\
            \ or\n with a subset of the bands of its parent.\n \n All constructors\
            \ are protected.  The correct way to create a\n Raster is to use one of\
            \ the static create methods defined in this\n class.  These methods create\
            \ instances of Raster that use the\n standard Interleaved, Banded, and\
            \ Packed SampleModels and that may\n be processed more efficiently than\
            \ a Raster created by combining\n an externally generated SampleModel\
            \ and DataBuffer."
