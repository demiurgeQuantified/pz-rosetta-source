          notes: "VolatileImage is an image which can lose its\n contents at any time\
            \ due to circumstances beyond the control of the\n application (e.g.,\
            \ situations caused by the operating system or by\n other applications).\
            \ Because of the potential for hardware acceleration,\n a VolatileImage\
            \ object can have significant performance benefits on\n some platforms.\n\
            \ \n The drawing surface of an image (the memory where the image contents\n\
            \ actually reside) can be lost or invalidated, causing the contents of\
            \ that\n memory to go away.  The drawing surface thus needs to be restored\n\
            \ or recreated and the contents of that surface need to be\n re-rendered.\
            \  VolatileImage provides an interface for\n allowing the user to detect\
            \ these problems and fix them\n when they occur.\n \n When a VolatileImage\
            \ object is created, limited system resources\n such as video memory (VRAM)\
            \ may be allocated in order to support\n the image.\n When a VolatileImage\
            \ object is no longer used, it may be\n garbage-collected and those system\
            \ resources will be returned,\n but this process does not happen at guaranteed\
            \ times.\n Applications that create many VolatileImage objects (for example,\n\
            \ a resizing window may force recreation of its back buffer as the\n size\
            \ changes) may run out of optimal system resources for new\n VolatileImage\
            \ objects simply because the old objects have not\n yet been removed from\
            \ the system.\n (New VolatileImage objects may still be created, but they\n\
            \ may not perform as well as those created in accelerated\n memory).\n\
            \ The flush method may be called at any time to proactively release\n\
            \ the resources used by a VolatileImage so that it does not prevent\n\
            \ subsequent VolatileImage objects from being accelerated.\n In this way,\
            \ applications can have more control over the state\n of the resources\
            \ taken up by obsolete VolatileImage objects.\n \n This image should not\
            \ be subclassed directly but should be created\n by using the Component.createVolatileImage\
            \ or\n GraphicsConfiguration.createCompatibleVolatileImage(int, int) methods.\n\
            \ \n An example of using a VolatileImage object follows:\n \n // image\
            \ creation\n VolatileImage vImg = createVolatileImage(w, h);\n\n\n //\
            \ rendering to the image\n void renderOffscreen() {\n      do {\n    \
            \      if (vImg.validate(getGraphicsConfiguration()) ==\n            \
            \  VolatileImage.IMAGE_INCOMPATIBLE)\n          {\n              // old\
            \ vImg doesn't work with new GraphicsConfig; re-create it\n          \
            \    vImg = createVolatileImage(w, h);\n          }\n          Graphics2D\
            \ g = vImg.createGraphics();\n          //\n          // miscellaneous\
            \ rendering commands...\n          //\n          g.dispose();\n      }\
            \ while (vImg.contentsLost());\n }\n\n\n // copying from the image (here,\
            \ gScreen is the Graphics\n // object for the onscreen window)\n do {\n\
            \      int returnCode = vImg.validate(getGraphicsConfiguration());\n \
            \     if (returnCode == VolatileImage.IMAGE_RESTORED) {\n          //\
            \ Contents need to be restored\n          renderOffscreen();      // restore\
            \ contents\n      } else if (returnCode == VolatileImage.IMAGE_INCOMPATIBLE)\
            \ {\n          // old vImg doesn't work with new GraphicsConfig; re-create\
            \ it\n          vImg = createVolatileImage(w, h);\n          renderOffscreen();\n\
            \      }\n      gScreen.drawImage(vImg, 0, 0, this);\n } while (vImg.contentsLost());\n\
            \ \n \n Note that this class subclasses from the Image class, which\n\
            \ includes methods that take an ImageObserver parameter for\n asynchronous\
            \ notifications as information is received from\n a potential ImageProducer.\
            \  Since this VolatileImage\n is not loaded from an asynchronous source,\
            \ the various methods that take\n an ImageObserver parameter will behave\
            \ as if the data has\n already been obtained from the ImageProducer.\n\
            \ Specifically, this means that the return values from such methods\n\
            \ will never indicate that the information is not yet available and\n\
            \ the ImageObserver used in such methods will never\n need to be recorded\
            \ for an asynchronous callback notification."
