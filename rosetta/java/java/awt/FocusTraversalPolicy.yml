          notes: "A FocusTraversalPolicy defines the order in which Components with\
            \ a\n particular focus cycle root are traversed. Instances can apply the\
            \ policy to\n arbitrary focus cycle roots, allowing themselves to be shared\
            \ across\n Containers. They do not need to be reinitialized when the focus\
            \ cycle roots\n of a Component hierarchy change.\n \n The core responsibility\
            \ of a FocusTraversalPolicy is to provide algorithms\n determining the\
            \ next and previous Components to focus when traversing\n forward or backward\
            \ in a UI. Each FocusTraversalPolicy must also provide\n algorithms for\
            \ determining the first, last, and default Components in a\n traversal\
            \ cycle. First and last Components are used when normal forward and\n\
            \ backward traversal, respectively, wraps. The default Component is the\
            \ first\n to receive focus when traversing down into a new focus traversal\
            \ cycle.\n A FocusTraversalPolicy can optionally provide an algorithm\
            \ for determining\n a Window's initial Component. The initial Component\
            \ is the first to receive\n focus when a Window is first made visible.\n\
            \ \n FocusTraversalPolicy takes into account focus traversal\n policy\
            \ providers.  When searching for first/last/next/previous Component,\n\
            \ if a focus traversal policy provider is encountered, its focus traversal\n\
            \ policy is used to perform the search operation.\n \n Please see\n \n\
            \ How to Use the Focus Subsystem,\n a section in The Java Tutorial, and\
            \ the\n Focus Specification\n for more information."
