          notes: "The Desktop class allows interact with various desktop capabilities.\n\
            \n  Supported operations include:\n \n   launching the user-default browser\
            \ to show a specified\n       URI;\n   launching the user-default mail\
            \ client with an optional\n       mailto URI;\n   launching a registered\
            \ application to open, edit or print a\n       specified file.\n \n\n\
            \  This class provides methods corresponding to these\n operations. The\
            \ methods look for the associated application\n registered on the current\
            \ platform, and launch it to handle a URI\n or file. If there is no associated\
            \ application or the associated\n application fails to be launched, an\
            \ exception is thrown.\n\n Please see Desktop.Action for the full list\
            \ of supported operations\n and capabilities.\n\n  An application is registered\
            \ to a URI or file type.\n The mechanism of registering, accessing, and\n\
            \ launching the associated application is platform-dependent.\n\n  Each\
            \ operation is an action type represented by the Desktop.Action class.\n\
            \n  Note: when some action is invoked and the associated\n application\
            \ is executed, it will be executed on the same system as\n the one on\
            \ which the Java application was launched."
