          notes: "The Composite interface, along with\n CompositeContext, defines\
            \ the methods to compose a draw\n primitive with the underlying graphics\
            \ area.\n After the Composite is set in the\n Graphics2D context, it combines\
            \ a shape, text, or an image\n being rendered with the colors that have\
            \ already been rendered\n according to pre-defined rules. The classes\n\
            \ implementing this interface provide the rules and a method to create\n\
            \ the context for a particular operation.\n CompositeContext is an environment\
            \ used by the\n compositing operation, which is created by the Graphics2D\n\
            \ prior to the start of the operation.  CompositeContext\n contains private\
            \ information and resources needed for a compositing\n operation.  When\
            \ the CompositeContext is no longer needed,\n the Graphics2D object disposes\
            \ of it in order to reclaim\n resources allocated for the operation.\n\
            \ \n Instances of classes implementing Composite must be\n immutable because\
            \ the Graphics2D does not clone\n these objects when they are set as an\
            \ attribute with the\n setComposite method or when the Graphics2D\n object\
            \ is cloned.  This is to avoid undefined rendering behavior of\n Graphics2D,\
            \ resulting from the modification of\n the Composite object after it has\
            \ been set in the\n Graphics2D context.\n \n Since this interface must\
            \ expose the contents of pixels on the\n target device or image to potentially\
            \ arbitrary code, the use of\n custom objects which implement this interface\
            \ when rendering directly\n to a screen device is governed by the readDisplayPixels\n\
            \ AWTPermission.  The permission check will occur when such\n a custom\
            \ object is passed to the setComposite method\n of a Graphics2D retrieved\
            \ from a Component."
