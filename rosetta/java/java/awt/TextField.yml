          notes: "A TextField object is a text component\n that allows for the editing\
            \ of a single line of text.\n \n For example, the following image depicts\
            \ a frame with four\n text fields of varying widths. Two of these text\
            \ fields\n display the predefined text \"Hello\".\n \n \n \n Here is the\
            \ code that produces these four text fields:\n\n \n TextField tf1, tf2,\
            \ tf3, tf4;\n // a blank text field\n tf1 = new TextField();\n // blank\
            \ field of 20 columns\n tf2 = new TextField(\"\", 20);\n // predefined\
            \ text displayed\n tf3 = new TextField(\"Hello!\");\n // predefined text\
            \ in 30 columns\n tf4 = new TextField(\"Hello\", 30);\n \n \n Every time\
            \ the user types a key in the text field, one or\n more key events are\
            \ sent to the text field.  A KeyEvent\n may be one of three types: keyPressed,\
            \ keyReleased, or keyTyped.\n The properties of a key event indicate which\
            \ of these types\n it is, as well as additional information about the\
            \ event,\n such as what modifiers are applied to the key event and the\n\
            \ time at which the event occurred.\n \n The key event is passed to every\
            \ KeyListener\n or KeyAdapter object which registered to receive such\n\
            \ events using the component's addKeyListener method.\n (KeyAdapter objects\
            \ implement the\n KeyListener interface.)\n \n It is also possible to\
            \ fire an ActionEvent.\n If action events are enabled for the text field,\
            \ they may\n be fired by pressing the Return key.\n \n The TextField class's\
            \ processEvent\n method examines the action event and passes it along\
            \ to\n processActionEvent. The latter method redirects the\n event to\
            \ any ActionListener objects that have\n registered to receive action\
            \ events generated by this\n text field."
