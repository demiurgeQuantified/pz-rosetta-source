          notes: "Input method events contain information about text that is being\n\
            \ composed using an input method. Whenever the text changes, the\n input\
            \ method sends an event. If the text component that's currently\n using\
            \ the input method is an active client, the event is dispatched\n to that\
            \ component. Otherwise, it is dispatched to a separate\n composition window.\n\
            \n \n The text included with the input method event consists of two parts:\n\
            \ committed text and composed text. Either part may be empty. The two\n\
            \ parts together replace any uncommitted composed text sent in previous\
            \ events,\n or the currently selected committed text.\n Committed text\
            \ should be integrated into the text component's persistent\n data, it\
            \ will not be sent again. Composed text may be sent repeatedly,\n with\
            \ changes to reflect the user's editing operations. Committed text\n always\
            \ precedes composed text."
