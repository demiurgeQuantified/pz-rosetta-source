          notes: "The listener interface for receiving component events.\n The class\
            \ that is interested in processing a component event\n either implements\
            \ this interface (and all the methods it\n contains) or extends the abstract\
            \ ComponentAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods of interest).\n\
            \ The listener object created from that class is then registered with\
            \ a\n component using the component's addComponentListener\n method. When\
            \ the component's size, location, or visibility\n changes, the relevant\
            \ method in the listener object is invoked,\n and the ComponentEvent is\
            \ passed to it.\n \n Component events are provided for notification purposes\
            \ ONLY;\n The AWT will automatically handle component moves and resizes\n\
            \ internally so that GUI layout works properly regardless of\n whether\
            \ a program registers a ComponentListener or not."
