          notes: "The listener interface for receiving WindowEvents, including\n WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS\
            \ and WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS events.\n The class that is interested in processing\
            \ a WindowEvent\n either implements this interface (and\n all the methods\
            \ it contains) or extends the abstract\n WindowAdapter class (overriding\
            \ only the methods of interest).\n The listener object created from that\
            \ class is then registered with a\n Window\n using the Window's addWindowFocusListener\
            \ method.\n When the Window's\n status changes by virtue of it being opened,\
            \ closed, activated, deactivated,\n iconified, or deiconified, or by focus\
            \ being transferred into or out of the\n Window, the relevant method in\
            \ the listener object is invoked,\n and the WindowEvent is passed to it."
