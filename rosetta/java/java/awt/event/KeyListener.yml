          notes: "The listener interface for receiving keyboard events (keystrokes).\n\
            \ The class that is interested in processing a keyboard event\n either\
            \ implements this interface (and all the methods it\n contains) or extends\
            \ the abstract KeyAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods of interest).\n\
            \ \n The listener object created from that class is then registered with\
            \ a\n component using the component's addKeyListener\n method. A keyboard\
            \ event is generated when a key is pressed, released,\n or typed. The\
            \ relevant method in the listener\n object is then invoked, and the KeyEvent\
            \ is passed to it."
