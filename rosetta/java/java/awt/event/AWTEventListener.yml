          notes: "The listener interface for receiving notification of events\n dispatched\
            \ to objects that are instances of Component or\n MenuComponent or their\
            \ subclasses.  Unlike the other EventListeners\n in this package, AWTEventListeners\
            \ passively observe events\n being dispatched in the AWT, system-wide.\
            \  Most applications\n should never use this class; applications which\
            \ might use\n AWTEventListeners include event recorders for automated\
            \ testing,\n and facilities such as the Java Accessibility package.\n\
            \ \n The class that is interested in monitoring AWT events\n implements\
            \ this interface, and the object created with that\n class is registered\
            \ with the Toolkit, using the Toolkit's\n addAWTEventListener method.\
            \  When an event is\n dispatched anywhere in the AWT, that object's\n\
            \ eventDispatched method is invoked."
