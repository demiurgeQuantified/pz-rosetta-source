          notes: "The listener interface for receiving window events.\n The class\
            \ that is interested in processing a window event\n either implements\
            \ this interface (and all the methods it\n contains) or extends the abstract\
            \ WindowAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods of interest).\n The\
            \ listener object created from that class is then registered with a\n\
            \ Window using the window's addWindowListener\n method. When the window's\
            \ status changes by virtue of being opened,\n closed, activated or deactivated,\
            \ iconified or deiconified,\n the relevant method in the listener object\
            \ is invoked, and the\n WindowEvent is passed to it."
