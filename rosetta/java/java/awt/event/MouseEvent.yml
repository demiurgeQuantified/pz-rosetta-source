          notes: "An event which indicates that a mouse action occurred in a component.\n\
            \ A mouse action is considered to occur in a particular component if and\
            \ only\n if the mouse cursor is over the unobscured part of the component's\
            \ bounds\n when the action happens.\n For lightweight components, such\
            \ as Swing's components, mouse events\n are only dispatched to the component\
            \ if the mouse event type has been\n enabled on the component. A mouse\
            \ event type is enabled by adding the\n appropriate mouse-based EventListener\
            \ to the component\n (MouseListener or MouseMotionListener), or by invoking\n\
            \ Component.enableEvents(long) with the appropriate mask parameter\n (AWTEvent.MOUSE_EVENT_MASK\
            \ or AWTEvent.MOUSE_MOTION_EVENT_MASK).\n If the mouse event type has\
            \ not been enabled on the component, the\n corresponding mouse events\
            \ are dispatched to the first ancestor that\n has enabled the mouse event\
            \ type.\n\n For example, if a MouseListener has been added to a component,\
            \ or\n enableEvents(AWTEvent.MOUSE_EVENT_MASK) has been invoked, then\
            \ all\n the events defined by MouseListener are dispatched to the component.\n\
            \ On the other hand, if a MouseMotionListener has not been added and\n\
            \ enableEvents has not been invoked with\n AWTEvent.MOUSE_MOTION_EVENT_MASK,\
            \ then mouse motion events are not\n dispatched to the component. Instead\
            \ the mouse motion events are\n dispatched to the first ancestors that\
            \ has enabled mouse motion\n events.\n \n This low-level event is generated\
            \ by a component object for:\n \n Mouse Events\n     \n     a mouse button\
            \ is pressed\n     a mouse button is released\n     a mouse button is\
            \ clicked (pressed and released)\n     the mouse cursor enters the unobscured\
            \ part of component's geometry\n     the mouse cursor exits the unobscured\
            \ part of component's geometry\n     \n  Mouse Motion Events\n     \n\
            \     the mouse is moved\n     the mouse is dragged\n     \n \n \n A MouseEvent\
            \ object is passed to every\n MouseListener\n or MouseAdapter object which\
            \ is registered to receive\n the \"interesting\" mouse events using the\
            \ component's\n addMouseListener method.\n (MouseAdapter objects implement\
            \ the\n MouseListener interface.) Each such listener object\n gets a MouseEvent\
            \ containing the mouse event.\n \n A MouseEvent object is also passed\
            \ to every\n MouseMotionListener or\n MouseMotionAdapter object which\
            \ is registered to receive\n mouse motion events using the component's\n\
            \ addMouseMotionListener\n method. (MouseMotionAdapter objects implement\
            \ the\n MouseMotionListener interface.) Each such listener object\n gets\
            \ a MouseEvent containing the mouse motion event.\n \n When a mouse button\
            \ is clicked, events are generated and sent to the\n registered MouseListeners.\n\
            \ The state of modal keys can be retrieved using InputEvent.getModifiers()\n\
            \ and InputEvent.getModifiersEx().\n The button mask returned by InputEvent.getModifiers()\
            \ reflects\n only the button that changed state, not the current state\
            \ of all buttons.\n (Note: Due to overlap in the values of ALT_MASK/BUTTON2_MASK\
            \ and\n META_MASK/BUTTON3_MASK, this is not always true for mouse events\
            \ involving\n modifier keys).\n To get the state of all buttons and modifier\
            \ keys, use\n InputEvent.getModifiersEx().\n The button which has changed\
            \ state is returned by getButton()\n \n For example, if the first mouse\
            \ button is pressed, events are sent in the\n following order:\n <b>\n\
            \    id              modifiers    button</b><code>\n    MOUSE_PRESSED:\
            \  BUTTON1_MASK BUTTON1\n    MOUSE_RELEASED: BUTTON1_MASK BUTTON1\n  \
            \  MOUSE_CLICKED:  BUTTON1_MASK BUTTON1\n </code>\n When multiple mouse\
            \ buttons are pressed, each press, release, and click\n results in a separate\
            \ event.\n \n For example, if the user presses button 1 followed by\n\
            \ button 2, and then releases them in the same order,\n the following\
            \ sequence of events is generated:\n <b>\n    id              modifiers\
            \    button</b><code>\n    MOUSE_PRESSED:  BUTTON1_MASK BUTTON1\n    MOUSE_PRESSED:\
            \  BUTTON2_MASK BUTTON2\n    MOUSE_RELEASED: BUTTON1_MASK BUTTON1\n  \
            \  MOUSE_CLICKED:  BUTTON1_MASK BUTTON1\n    MOUSE_RELEASED: BUTTON2_MASK\
            \ BUTTON2\n    MOUSE_CLICKED:  BUTTON2_MASK BUTTON2\n </code>\n If button\
            \ 2 is released first, the\n MOUSE_RELEASED/MOUSE_CLICKED pair\n for BUTTON2_MASK\
            \ arrives first,\n followed by the pair for BUTTON1_MASK.\n \n Some extra\
            \ mouse buttons are added to extend the standard set of buttons\n represented\
            \ by the following constants:BUTTON1, BUTTON2, and BUTTON3.\n Extra buttons\
            \ have no assigned BUTTONx\n constants as well as their button masks have\
            \ no assigned BUTTONx_DOWN_MASK\n constants. Nevertheless, ordinal numbers\
            \ starting from 4 may be\n used as button numbers (button ids). Values\
            \ obtained by the\n getMaskForButton(button) method may be used\n as button\
            \ masks.\n \n MOUSE_DRAGGED events are delivered to the Component\n in\
            \ which the mouse button was pressed until the mouse button is released\n\
            \ (regardless of whether the mouse position is within the bounds of the\n\
            \ Component).  Due to platform-dependent Drag&Drop implementations,\n\
            \ MOUSE_DRAGGED events may not be delivered during a native\n Drag&Drop\
            \ operation.\n\n In a multi-screen environment mouse drag events are delivered\
            \ to the\n Component even if the mouse position is outside the bounds\
            \ of the\n GraphicsConfiguration associated with that\n Component. However,\
            \ the reported position for mouse drag events\n in this case may differ\
            \ from the actual mouse position:\n \n In a multi-screen environment without\
            \ a virtual device:\n \n The reported coordinates for mouse drag events\
            \ are clipped to fit within the\n bounds of the GraphicsConfiguration\
            \ associated with\n the Component.\n In a multi-screen environment with\
            \ a virtual device:\n \n The reported coordinates for mouse drag events\
            \ are clipped to fit within the\n bounds of the virtual device associated\
            \ with the Component.\n \n \n An unspecified behavior will be caused if\
            \ the id parameter\n of any particular MouseEvent instance is not\n in\
            \ the range from MOUSE_FIRST to MOUSE_LAST-1\n (MOUSE_WHEEL is not acceptable)."
