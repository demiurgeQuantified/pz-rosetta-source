          notes: "The listener interface for receiving \"interesting\" mouse events\n\
            \ (press, release, click, enter, and exit) on a component.\n (To track\
            \ mouse moves and mouse drags, use the\n MouseMotionListener.)\n \n The\
            \ class that is interested in processing a mouse event\n either implements\
            \ this interface (and all the methods it\n contains) or extends the abstract\
            \ MouseAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods of interest).\n \n\
            \ The listener object created from that class is then registered with\
            \ a\n component using the component's addMouseListener\n method. A mouse\
            \ event is generated when the mouse is pressed, released\n clicked (pressed\
            \ and released). A mouse event is also generated when\n the mouse cursor\
            \ enters or leaves a component. When a mouse event\n occurs, the relevant\
            \ method in the listener object is invoked, and\n the MouseEvent is passed\
            \ to it."
