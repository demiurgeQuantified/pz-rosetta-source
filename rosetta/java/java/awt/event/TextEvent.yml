          notes: "A semantic event which indicates that an object's text changed.\n\
            \ This high-level event is generated by an object (such as a TextComponent)\n\
            \ when its text changes. The event is passed to\n every TextListener object\
            \ which registered to receive such\n events using the component's addTextListener\
            \ method.\n \n The object that implements the TextListener interface gets\n\
            \ this TextEvent when the event occurs. The listener is\n spared the details\
            \ of processing individual mouse movements and key strokes\n Instead,\
            \ it can process a \"meaningful\" (semantic) event like \"text changed\"\
            .\n \n An unspecified behavior will be caused if the id parameter\n of\
