          notes: "The listener interface for receiving hierarchy changed events.\n\
            \ The class that is interested in processing a hierarchy changed event\n\
            \ should implement this interface.\n The listener object created from\
            \ that class is then registered with a\n Component using the Component's\
            \ addHierarchyListener\n method. When the hierarchy to which the Component\
            \ belongs changes, the\n hierarchyChanged method in the listener object\
            \ is invoked,\n and the HierarchyEvent is passed to it.\n \n Hierarchy\
            \ events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;\n The AWT will automatically\
            \ handle changes to the hierarchy internally so\n that GUI layout, displayability,\
            \ and visibility work properly regardless\n of whether a program registers\
            \ a HierarchyListener or not."
