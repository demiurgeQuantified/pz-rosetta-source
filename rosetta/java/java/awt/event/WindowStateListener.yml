          notes: "The listener interface for receiving window state events.\n \n The\
            \ class that is interested in processing a window state event\n either\
            \ implements this interface (and all the methods it contains)\n or extends\
            \ the abstract WindowAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods of interest).\n\
            \ \n The listener object created from that class is then registered with\n\
            \ a window using the Window's\n addWindowStateListener method.  When the\
            \ window's\n state changes by virtue of being iconified, maximized etc.,\
            \ the\n windowStateChanged method in the listener object is\n invoked,\
            \ and the WindowEvent is passed to it."
