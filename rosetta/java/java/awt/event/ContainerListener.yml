          notes: "The listener interface for receiving container events.\n The class\
            \ that is interested in processing a container event\n either implements\
            \ this interface (and all the methods it\n contains) or extends the abstract\
            \ ContainerAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods of interest).\n\
            \ The listener object created from that class is then registered with\
            \ a\n component using the component's addContainerListener\n method. When\
            \ the container's contents change because a component\n has been added\
            \ or removed, the relevant method in the listener object\n is invoked,\
            \ and the ContainerEvent is passed to it.\n \n Container events are provided\
            \ for notification purposes ONLY;\n The AWT will automatically handle\
            \ add and remove operations\n internally so the program works properly\
            \ regardless of\n whether the program registers a ContainerListener or\
            \ not."
