          notes: "An event which indicates that the mouse wheel was rotated in a component.\n\
            \ \n A wheel mouse is a mouse which has a wheel in place of the middle\
            \ button.\n This wheel can be rotated towards or away from the user. \
            \ Mouse wheels are\n most often used for scrolling, though other uses\
            \ are possible.\n \n A MouseWheelEvent object is passed to every MouseWheelListener\n\
            \ object which registered to receive the \"interesting\" mouse events\
            \ using the\n component's addMouseWheelListener method.  Each such listener\n\
            \ object gets a MouseEvent containing the mouse event.\n \n Due to the\
            \ mouse wheel's special relationship to scrolling Components,\n MouseWheelEvents\
            \ are delivered somewhat differently than other MouseEvents.\n This is\
            \ because while other MouseEvents usually affect a change on\n the Component\
            \ directly under the mouse\n cursor (for instance, when clicking a button),\
            \ MouseWheelEvents often have\n an effect away from the mouse cursor (moving\
            \ the wheel while\n over a Component inside a ScrollPane should scroll\
            \ one of the\n Scrollbars on the ScrollPane).\n \n MouseWheelEvents start\
            \ delivery from the Component underneath the\n mouse cursor.  If MouseWheelEvents\
            \ are not enabled on the\n Component, the event is delivered to the first\
            \ ancestor\n Container with MouseWheelEvents enabled.  This will usually\
            \ be\n a ScrollPane with wheel scrolling enabled.  The source\n Component\
            \ and x,y coordinates will be relative to the event's\n final destination\
            \ (the ScrollPane).  This allows a complex\n GUI to be installed without\
            \ modification into a ScrollPane, and\n for all MouseWheelEvents to be\
            \ delivered to the ScrollPane for\n scrolling.\n \n Some AWT Components\
            \ are implemented using native widgets which\n display their own scrollbars\
            \ and handle their own scrolling.\n The particular Components for which\
            \ this is true will vary from\n platform to platform.  When the mouse\
            \ wheel is\n moved over one of these Components, the event is delivered\
            \ straight to\n the native widget, and not propagated to ancestors.\n\
            \ \n Platforms offer customization of the amount of scrolling that\n should\
            \ take place when the mouse wheel is moved.  The two most\n common settings\
            \ are to scroll a certain number of \"units\"\n (commonly lines of text\
            \ in a text-based component) or an entire \"block\"\n (similar to page-up/page-down).\
            \  The MouseWheelEvent offers\n methods for conforming to the underlying\
            \ platform settings.  These\n platform settings can be changed at any\
            \ time by the user.  MouseWheelEvents\n reflect the most recent settings.\n\
            \ \n The MouseWheelEvent class includes methods for\n getting the number\
            \ of \"clicks\" by which the mouse wheel is rotated.\n The getWheelRotation()\
            \ method returns the integer number\n of \"clicks\" corresponding to the\
            \ number of notches by which the wheel was\n rotated. In addition to this\
            \ method, the MouseWheelEvent\n class provides the getPreciseWheelRotation()\
            \ method which returns\n a double number of \"clicks\" in case a partial\
            \ rotation occurred.\n The getPreciseWheelRotation() method is useful\
            \ if a mouse supports\n a high-resolution wheel, such as a freely rotating\
            \ wheel with no\n notches. Applications can benefit by using this method\
            \ to process\n mouse wheel events more precisely, and thus, making visual\
            \ perception\n smoother."
