          notes: "The listener interface for receiving keyboard focus events on\n\
            \ a component.\n The class that is interested in processing a focus event\n\
            \ either implements this interface (and all the methods it\n contains)\
            \ or extends the abstract FocusAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods\
            \ of interest).\n The listener object created from that class is then\
            \ registered with a\n component using the component's addFocusListener\n\
            \ method. When the component gains or loses the keyboard focus,\n the\
            \ relevant method in the listener object\n is invoked, and the FocusEvent\
            \ is passed to it."
