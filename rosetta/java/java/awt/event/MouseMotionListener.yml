          notes: "The listener interface for receiving mouse motion events on a component.\n\
            \ (For clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseListener.)\n \n The\
            \ class that is interested in processing a mouse motion event\n either\
            \ implements this interface (and all the methods it\n contains) or extends\
            \ the abstract MouseMotionAdapter class\n (overriding only the methods\
            \ of interest).\n \n The listener object created from that class is then\
            \ registered with a\n component using the component's addMouseMotionListener\n\
            \ method. A mouse motion event is generated when the mouse is moved\n\
            \ or dragged. (Many such events will be generated). When a mouse motion\
            \ event\n occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,\
            \ and\n the MouseEvent is passed to it."
