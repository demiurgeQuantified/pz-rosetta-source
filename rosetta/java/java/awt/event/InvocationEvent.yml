              \ called by a waiting thread that calls the notifier.wait() method.\n\
              \ Since spurious wakeups are possible (as explained in Object.wait()),\n\
              \ this method should be used in a waiting loop to ensure that the event\n\
              \ got dispatched:\n \n     while (!event.isDispatched()) {\n       \
              \  notifier.wait();\n     }\n \n If the waiting thread wakes up without\
              \ dispatching the event,\n the isDispatched() method returns false,\
              \ and\n the while loop executes once more, thus, causing\n the awakened\
              \ thread to revert to the waiting mode.\n \n If the notifier.notifyAll()\
              \ happens before the waiting thread\n enters the notifier.wait() method,\
              \ the while loop ensures\n that the waiting thread will not enter the\
              \ notifier.wait() method.\n Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the\
              \ waiting thread will ever be woken\n from the wait."
