          notes: "The listener interface for receiving mouse wheel events on a component.\n\
            \ (For clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseListener.\n For mouse\
            \ movement and drags, use the MouseMotionListener.)\n \n The class that\
            \ is interested in processing a mouse wheel event\n implements this interface\
            \ (and all the methods it contains).\n \n The listener object created\
            \ from that class is then registered with a\n component using the component's\
            \ addMouseWheelListener\n method. A mouse wheel event is generated when\
            \ the mouse wheel is rotated.\n When a mouse wheel event occurs, that\
            \ object's mouseWheelMoved\n method is invoked.\n \n For information on\
            \ how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see\n the class description for\
            \ MouseWheelEvent."
