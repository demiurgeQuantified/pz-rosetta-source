          notes: "The listener interface for receiving ancestor moved and resized\
            \ events.\n The class that is interested in processing these events either\
            \ implements\n this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends\
            \ the abstract\n HierarchyBoundsAdapter class (overriding only the method\
            \ of\n interest).\n The listener object created from that class is then\
            \ registered with a\n Component using the Component's addHierarchyBoundsListener\n\
            \ method. When the hierarchy to which the Component belongs changes by\n\
            \ the resizing or movement of an ancestor, the relevant method in the\
            \ listener\n object is invoked, and the HierarchyEvent is passed to it.\n\
            \ \n Hierarchy events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;\n The\
            \ AWT will automatically handle changes to the hierarchy internally so\n\
            \ that GUI layout works properly regardless of whether a\n program registers\
            \ an HierarchyBoundsListener or not."
