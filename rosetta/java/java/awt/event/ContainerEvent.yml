          notes: "A low-level event which indicates that a container's contents\n\
            \ changed because a component was added or removed.\n \n Container events\
            \ are provided for notification purposes ONLY;\n The AWT will automatically\
            \ handle changes to the containers\n contents internally so that the program\
            \ works properly regardless of\n whether the program is receiving these\
            \ events or not.\n \n This low-level event is generated by a container\
            \ object (such as a\n Panel) when a component is added to it or removed\
            \ from it.\n The event is passed to every ContainerListener\n or ContainerAdapter\
            \ object which registered to receive such\n events using the component's\
            \ addContainerListener method.\n (ContainerAdapter objects implement the\n\
            \ ContainerListener interface.) Each such listener object\n gets this\
            \ ContainerEvent when the event occurs.\n \n An unspecified behavior will\
            \ be caused if the id parameter\n of any particular ContainerEvent instance\
            \ is not\n in the range from CONTAINER_FIRST to CONTAINER_LAST."
