          notes: "The FontMetrics class defines a font metrics object, which\n encapsulates\
            \ information about the rendering of a particular font on a\n particular\
            \ screen.\n \n Note to subclassers: Since many of these methods form closed,\n\
            \ mutually recursive loops, you must take care that you implement\n at\
            \ least one of the methods in each such loop to prevent\n infinite recursion\
            \ when your subclass is used.\n In particular, the following is the minimal\
            \ suggested set of methods\n to override in order to ensure correctness\
            \ and prevent infinite\n recursion (though other subsets are equally feasible):\n\
            \ \n getAscent()\n getLeading()\n getMaxAdvance()\n charWidth(char)\n\
            \ charsWidth(char[], int, int)\n \n \n \n Note that the implementations\
            \ of these methods are\n inefficient, so they are usually overridden with\
            \ more efficient\n toolkit-specific implementations.\n \n When an application\
            \ asks to place a character at the position\n (x, y), the character is\
            \ placed so that its\n reference point (shown as the dot in the accompanying\
            \ image) is\n put at that position. The reference point specifies a horizontal\n\
            \ line called the baseline of the character. In normal\n printing, the\
            \ baselines of characters should align.\n \n In addition, every character\
            \ in a font has an ascent, a\n descent, and an advance width. The ascent\
            \ is the\n amount by which the character ascends above the baseline. The\n\
            \ descent is the amount by which the character descends below the\n baseline.\
            \ The advance width indicates the position at which AWT\n should place\
            \ the next character.\n \n An array of characters or a string can also\
            \ have an ascent, a\n descent, and an advance width. The ascent of the\
            \ array is the\n maximum ascent of any character in the array. The descent\
            \ is the\n maximum descent of any character in the array. The advance\
            \ width\n is the sum of the advance widths of each of the characters in\
            \ the\n character array.  The advance of a String is the\n distance along\
            \ the baseline of the String.  This\n distance is the width that should\
            \ be used for centering or\n right-aligning the String.\n Note that the\
            \ advance of a String is not necessarily\n the sum of the advances of\
            \ its characters measured in isolation\n because the width of a character\
            \ can vary depending on its context.\n For example, in Arabic text, the\
            \ shape of a character can change\n in order to connect to other characters.\
            \  Also, in some scripts,\n certain character sequences can be represented\
            \ by a single shape,\n called a ligature.  Measuring characters individually\
            \ does\n not account for these transformations.\n Font metrics are baseline-relative,\
            \ meaning that they are\n generally independent of the rotation applied\
            \ to the font (modulo\n possible grid hinting effects).  See Font."

              \ caveats, enumerated below.\n \n The advance is the distance from the\
              \ leftmost point used to position\n the character to the rightmost point\
              \ along the baseline.\n This is not the same thing as the visible width\
              \ of the glyph image\n representing the character.\n \n The advance\
              \ of a String is not necessarily the sum of the\n advances of its characters.\
              \ It may differ substantially if\n complex text layout is required for\
              \ proper rendering.\n \n Some of the caveats of the reported value include\n\
              \ \n  The returned value is relying upon information from some\n underlying\
              \ system font, and the correctness of that information\n is outside\
              \ of AWT's control.\n  When specific characters are mapped into glyphs\n\
              \ in some rendering context, instructions in the font itself\n together\
              \ with the rasterization process may cause some glyph\n to have a wider\
              \ advance than reported.\n  When a font is requested in some style,\
              \ eg Font.BOLD,\n for which no exact match is available, then techniques\
              \ to satisfy\n the requested rendering may similarly result in glyphs\
              \ that are\n wider than the reported maximum.\n  Depending on the implementation,\
              \ an AWT logical font or\n physical font may need to locate some characters\
              \ from one or more\n \"fall back\" fonts, when the primary underlying\
              \ physical font does not\n support the character. These fonts may not\
              \ all be known or considered\n in the calculation of the reported maximum\
              \ advance. It is common\n for the design center of such fall back fonts\
              \ to be for a different\n script than the design center of the primary\
              \ font, so their\n advances can be quite different. This can also lead\
              \ to the\n unexpected result that a font such as Font.MONOSPACED can\n\
              \ render glyphs that are not all the same width.\n \n None of these\
              \ caveats are exposed as they are all implementation details,\n and\
              \ there is no practical way to determine when these are in effect.\n\
              \ An application which needs a better estimate of the maximum advance,\n\
              \ and knows the subset of characters it expects to display can query\n\
              \ the advance of each such character to find the widest, however,\n\
              \ as discussed above, since the displayed width of a String\n is not\
              \ necessarily the sum of the advances the value still needs\n to be\
              \ used with caution.\n \n In summary, this method makes no absolute\
              \ guarantee, nor can\n it even make a guarantee to be correct within\
              \ some margin of error.\n So it should be used at most only for estimating\
              \ the total space\n sufficient to display some number of as yet unknown\
              \ characters from\n the font. And that might be either an overestimate,\
              \ or an\n underestimate depending on the specific text and rendering\
              \ conext."
