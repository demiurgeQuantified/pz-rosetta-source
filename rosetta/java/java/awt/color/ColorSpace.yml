          notes: "This abstract class is used to serve as a color space tag to identify\
            \ the\n specific color space of a Color object or, via a ColorModel\n\
            \ object, of an Image, a BufferedImage, or a\n GraphicsDevice. It contains\
            \ methods that transform colors in a\n specific color space to/from sRGB\
            \ and to/from a well-defined CIEXYZ color\n space.\n \n For purposes of\
            \ the methods in this class, colors are represented as arrays\n of color\
            \ components represented as floats in a normalized range defined by\n\
            \ each ColorSpace. For many ColorSpaces (e.g. sRGB), this range\n is 0.0\
            \ to 1.0. However, some ColorSpaces have components whose values\n have\
            \ a different range. Methods are provided to inquire per component minimum\n\
            \ and maximum normalized values.\n \n Several variables are defined for\
            \ purposes of referring to color space types\n (e.g. TYPE_RGB, TYPE_XYZ,\
            \ etc.) and to refer to specific\n color spaces (e.g. CS_sRGB and CS_CIEXYZ).\
            \ sRGB is a proposed\n standard RGB color space. For more information,\
            \ see\n \n http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html.\n \n The\
            \ purpose of the methods to transform to/from the well-defined CIEXYZ\
            \ color\n space is to support conversions between any two color spaces\
            \ at a reasonably\n high degree of accuracy. It is expected that particular\
            \ implementations of\n subclasses of ColorSpace (e.g. ICC_ColorSpace)\
            \ will support\n high performance conversion based on underlying platform\
            \ color management\n systems.\n \n The CS_CIEXYZ space used by the toCIEXYZ/fromCIEXYZ\
            \ methods\n can be described as follows:\n \n\n     CIEXYZ\n     viewing\
            \ illuminance: 200 lux\n     viewing white point: CIE D50\n     media\
            \ white point: \"that of a perfectly reflecting diffuser\" -- D50\n  \
            \   media black point: 0 lux or 0 Reflectance\n     flare: 1 percent\n\

            \ is applicable. Use a simple Von Kries\n           white point adaptation\
            \ folded into the 3X3 matrix parameters\n           and fold the flare\
            \ and surround effects into the three\n           one-dimensional lookup\
