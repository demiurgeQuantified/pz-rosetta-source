          notes: "The GlyphMetrics class represents information for a\n single glyph.\
            \   A glyph is the visual representation of one or more\n characters.\
            \  Many different glyphs can be used to represent a single\n character\
            \ or combination of characters.  GlyphMetrics\n instances are produced\
            \ by Font and are applicable\n to a specific glyph in a particular Font.\n\
            \ \n Glyphs are either STANDARD, LIGATURE, COMBINING, or COMPONENT.\n\
            \ \n STANDARD glyphs are commonly used to represent single characters.\n\
            \ LIGATURE glyphs are used to represent sequences of characters.\n COMPONENT\
            \ glyphs in a GlyphVector do not correspond to a\n particular character\
            \ in a text model. Instead, COMPONENT glyphs are\n added for typographical\
            \ reasons, such as Arabic justification.\n COMBINING glyphs embellish\
            \ STANDARD or LIGATURE glyphs, such\n as accent marks.  Carets do not\
            \ appear before COMBINING glyphs.\n \n \n Other metrics available through\
            \ GlyphMetrics are the\n components of the advance, the visual bounds,\
            \ and the left and right\n side bearings.\n \n Glyphs for a rotated font,\
            \ or obtained from a GlyphVector\n which has applied a rotation to the\
            \ glyph, can have advances that\n contain both X and Y components.  Usually\
            \ the advance only has one\n component.\n \n The advance of a glyph is\
            \ the distance from the glyph's origin to the\n origin of the next glyph\
            \ along the baseline, which is either vertical\n or horizontal.  Note\
            \ that, in a GlyphVector,\n the distance from a glyph to its following\
            \ glyph might not be the\n glyph's advance, because of kerning or other\
            \ positioning adjustments.\n \n The bounds is the smallest rectangle that\
            \ completely contains the\n outline of the glyph.  The bounds rectangle\
            \ is relative to the\n glyph's origin.  The left-side bearing is the distance\
            \ from the glyph\n origin to the left of its bounds rectangle. If the\
            \ left-side bearing is\n negative, part of the glyph is drawn to the left\
            \ of its origin.  The\n right-side bearing is the distance from the right\
            \ side of the bounds\n rectangle to the next glyph origin (the origin\
            \ plus the advance).  If\n negative, part of the glyph is drawn to the\
            \ right of the next glyph's\n origin.  Note that the bounds does not necessarily\
            \ enclose all the pixels\n affected when rendering the glyph, because\
            \ of rasterization and pixel\n adjustment effects.\n \n Although instances\
            \ of GlyphMetrics can be directly\n constructed, they are almost always\
            \ obtained from a\n GlyphVector.  Once constructed, GlyphMetrics\n objects\
            \ are immutable.\n \n Example:\n Querying a Font for glyph information\n\
            \ \n Font font = ...;\n int glyphIndex = ...;\n GlyphMetrics metrics =\
            \ GlyphVector.getGlyphMetrics(glyphIndex);\n int isStandard = metrics.isStandard();\n\
            \ float glyphAdvance = metrics.getAdvance();"
