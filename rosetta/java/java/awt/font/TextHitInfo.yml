          notes: "The TextHitInfo class represents a character position in a\n text\
            \ model, and a bias, or \"side,\" of the character.  Biases are\n either\
            \ leading (the left edge, for a left-to-right character)\n or trailing\
            \ (the right edge, for a left-to-right character).\n Instances of TextHitInfo\
            \ are used to specify caret and\n insertion positions within text.\n \n\
            \ For example, consider the text \"abc\".  TextHitInfo.trailing(1)\n corresponds\
            \ to the right side of the 'b' in the text.\n \n TextHitInfo is used primarily\
            \ by TextLayout and\n clients of TextLayout.  Clients of TextLayout\n\
            \ query TextHitInfo instances for an insertion offset, where\n new text\
            \ is inserted into the text model.  The insertion offset is equal\n to\
            \ the character position in the TextHitInfo if the bias\n is leading,\
            \ and one character after if the bias is trailing.  The\n insertion offset\
            \ for TextHitInfo.trailing(1) is 2.\n \n Sometimes it is convenient to\
            \ construct a TextHitInfo with\n the same insertion offset as an existing\
            \ one, but on the opposite\n character.  The getOtherHit method constructs\
            \ a new\n TextHitInfo with the same insertion offset as an existing\n\
            \ one, with a hit on the character on the other side of the insertion\
            \ offset.\n Calling getOtherHit on trailing(1) would return leading(2).\n\
            \ In general, getOtherHit for trailing(n) returns\n leading(n+1) and getOtherHit\
            \ for leading(n)\n returns trailing(n-1).\n \n Example:\n Converting a\
            \ graphical point to an insertion point within a text\n model\n \n TextLayout\
            \ layout = ...;\n Point2D.Float hitPoint = ...;\n TextHitInfo hitInfo\
            \ = layout.hitTestChar(hitPoint.x, hitPoint.y);\n int insPoint = hitInfo.getInsertionIndex();\n\
            \ // insPoint is relative to layout;  may need to adjust for use\n //\
            \ in a text model"
