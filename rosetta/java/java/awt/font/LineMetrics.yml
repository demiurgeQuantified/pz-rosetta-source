          notes: "The LineMetrics class allows access to the\n metrics needed to layout\
            \ characters along a line\n and to layout of a set of lines.  A LineMetrics\n\
            \ object encapsulates the measurement information associated\n with a\
            \ run of text.\n \n Fonts can have different metrics for different ranges\
            \ of\n characters.  The getLineMetrics methods of\n Font take some text\
            \ as an argument\n and return a LineMetrics object describing the\n metrics\
            \ of the initial number of characters in that text, as\n returned by getNumChars()."
