          notes: "A GlyphVector object is a collection of glyphs\n containing geometric\
            \ information for the placement of each glyph\n in a transformed coordinate\
            \ space which corresponds to the\n device on which the GlyphVector is\
            \ ultimately\n displayed.\n \n The GlyphVector does not attempt any interpretation\
            \ of\n the sequence of glyphs it contains.  Relationships between adjacent\n\
            \ glyphs in sequence are solely used to determine the placement of\n the\
            \ glyphs in the visual coordinate space.\n \n Instances of GlyphVector\
            \ are created by a Font.\n \n In a text processing application that can\
            \ cache intermediate\n representations of text, creation and subsequent\
            \ caching of a\n GlyphVector for use during rendering is the fastest\n\
            \ method to present the visual representation of characters to a user.\n\
            \ \n A GlyphVector is associated with exactly one\n Font, and can provide\
            \ data useful only in relation to\n this Font.  In addition, metrics obtained\
            \ from a\n GlyphVector are not generally geometrically scalable\n since\
            \ the pixelization and spacing are dependent on grid-fitting\n algorithms\
            \ within a Font.  To facilitate accurate\n measurement of a GlyphVector\
            \ and its component\n glyphs, you must specify a scaling transform, anti-alias\
            \ mode, and\n fractional metrics mode when creating the GlyphVector.\n\
            \ These characteristics can be derived from the destination device.\n\
            \ \n For each glyph in the GlyphVector, you can obtain:\n \n the position\
            \ of the glyph\n the transform associated with the glyph\n the metrics\
            \ of the glyph in the context of the\n   GlyphVector.  The metrics of\
            \ the glyph may be\n   different under different transforms, application\
            \ specified\n   rendering hints, and the specific instance of the glyph\
            \ within\n   the GlyphVector.\n \n \n Altering the data used to create\
            \ the GlyphVector does not\n alter the state of the GlyphVector.\n \n\
            \ Methods are provided to adjust the positions of the glyphs\n within\
            \ the GlyphVector.  These methods are most\n appropriate for applications\
            \ that are performing justification\n operations for the presentation\
            \ of the glyphs.\n \n Methods are provided to transform individual glyphs\
            \ within the\n GlyphVector.  These methods are primarily useful for\n\
            \ special effects.\n \n Methods are provided to return both the visual,\
            \ logical, and pixel bounds\n of the entire GlyphVector or of individual\
            \ glyphs within\n the GlyphVector.\n \n Methods are provided to return\
            \ a Shape for the\n GlyphVector, and for individual glyphs within the\n\
            \ GlyphVector."
