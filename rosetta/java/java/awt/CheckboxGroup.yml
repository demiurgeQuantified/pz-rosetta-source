          notes: "The CheckboxGroup class is used to group together\n a set of Checkbox\
            \ buttons.\n \n Exactly one check box button in a CheckboxGroup can\n\
            \ be in the \"on\" state at any given time. Pushing any\n button sets\
            \ its state to \"on\" and forces any other button that\n is in the \"\
            on\" state into the \"off\" state.\n \n The following code example produces\
            \ a new check box group,\n with three check boxes:\n\n \n setLayout(new\
            \ GridLayout(3, 1));\n CheckboxGroup cbg = new CheckboxGroup();\n add(new\
            \ Checkbox(\"one\", cbg, true));\n add(new Checkbox(\"two\", cbg, false));\n\
            \ add(new Checkbox(\"three\", cbg, false));\n \n \n This image depicts\
            \ the check box group created by this example:"
