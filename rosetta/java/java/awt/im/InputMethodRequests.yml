          notes: "InputMethodRequests defines the requests that a text editing component\n\
            \ has to handle in order to work with input methods. The component\n can\
            \ implement this interface itself or use a separate object that\n implements\
            \ it. The object implementing this interface must be returned\n from the\
            \ component's getInputMethodRequests method.\n\n \n The text editing component\
            \ also has to provide an input method event\n listener.\n\n \n The interface\
            \ is designed to support one of two input user interfaces:\n \n on-the-spot\
            \ input, where the composed text is displayed as part\n     of the text\
            \ component's text body.\n below-the-spot input, where the composed text\
            \ is displayed in\n     a separate composition window just below the insertion\
            \ point where\n     the text will be inserted when it is committed. Note\
            \ that, if text is\n     selected within the component's text body, this\
            \ text will be replaced by\n     the committed text upon commitment; therefore\
            \ it is not considered part\n     of the context that the text is input\
            \ into."
