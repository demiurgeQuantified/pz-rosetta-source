          notes: "A symbolic reference obtained by cracking a direct method handle\n\
            \ into its constituent symbolic parts.\n To crack a direct method handle,\
            \ call Lookup.revealDirect.\n Direct Method Handles\n A direct method\
            \ handle represents a method, constructor, or field without\n any intervening\
            \ argument bindings or other transformations.\n The method, constructor,\
            \ or field referred to by a direct method handle is called\n its underlying\
            \ member.\n Direct method handles may be obtained in any of these ways:\n\
            \ \n By executing an ldc instruction on a CONSTANT_MethodHandle constant.\n\
            \     (See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, sections 4.4.8 and\
            \ 5.4.3.)\n By calling one of the Lookup Factory Methods,\n     such as\
            \ Lookup.findVirtual,\n     to resolve a symbolic reference into a method\
            \ handle.\n     A symbolic reference consists of a class, name string,\
            \ and type.\n By calling the factory method Lookup.unreflect\n     or\
            \ Lookup.unreflectSpecial\n     to convert a Method into a method handle.\n\
            \ By calling the factory method Lookup.unreflectConstructor\n     to convert\
            \ a Constructor into a method handle.\n By calling the factory method\
            \ Lookup.unreflectGetter\n     or Lookup.unreflectSetter\n     to convert\
            \ a Field into a method handle.\n \n\n Restrictions on Cracking\n Given\
            \ a suitable Lookup object, it is possible to crack any direct method\
            \ handle\n to recover a symbolic reference for the underlying method,\
            \ constructor, or field.\n Cracking must be done via a Lookup object equivalent\
            \ to that which created\n the target method handle, or which has enough\
            \ access permissions to recreate\n an equivalent method handle.\n \n If\
            \ the underlying method is caller sensitive,\n the direct method handle\
            \ will have been \"bound\" to a particular caller class, the\n lookup\
            \ class\n of the lookup object used to create it.\n Cracking this method\
            \ handle with a different lookup class will fail\n even if the underlying\
            \ method is public (like Class.forName).\n \n The requirement of lookup\
            \ object matching provides a \"fast fail\" behavior\n for programs which\
            \ may otherwise trust erroneous revelation of a method\n handle with symbolic\
            \ information (or caller binding) from an unexpected scope.\n Use MethodHandles.reflectAs(java.lang.Class<T>,\
            \ java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle) to override this limitation.\n\n Reference\
            \ kinds\n The Lookup Factory Methods\n correspond to all major use cases\
            \ for methods, constructors, and fields.\n These use cases may be distinguished\
            \ using small integers as follows:\n \n reference kinds\n \n reference\
