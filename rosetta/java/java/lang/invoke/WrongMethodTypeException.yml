          notes: "Thrown to indicate that code has attempted to call a method handle\n\
            \ via the wrong method type.  As with the bytecode representation of\n\
            \ normal Java method calls, method handle calls are strongly typed\n to\
            \ a specific type descriptor associated with a call site.\n \n This exception\
            \ may also be thrown when two method handles are\n composed, and the system\
            \ detects that their types cannot be\n matched up correctly.  This amounts\
            \ to an early evaluation\n of the type mismatch, at method handle construction\
            \ time,\n instead of when the mismatched method handle is called."
