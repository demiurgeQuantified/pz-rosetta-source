          notes: "Serialized form of a lambda expression.  The properties of this\
            \ class\n represent the information that is present at the lambda factory\
            \ site, including\n static metafactory arguments such as the identity\
            \ of the primary functional\n interface method and the identity of the\
            \ implementation method, as well as\n dynamic metafactory arguments such\
            \ as values captured from the lexical scope\n at the time of lambda capture.\n\
            \n Implementors of serializable lambdas, such as compilers or language\n\
            \ runtime libraries, are expected to ensure that instances deserialize\
            \ properly.\n One means to do so is to ensure that the writeReplace method\
            \ returns\n an instance of SerializedLambda, rather than allowing default\n\
            \ serialization to proceed.\n\n SerializedLambda has a readResolve method\
            \ that looks for\n a (possibly private) static method called\n $deserializeLambda$(SerializedLambda)\
            \ in the capturing class, invokes\n that with itself as the first argument,\
            \ and returns the result.  Lambda classes\n implementing $deserializeLambda$\
            \ are responsible for validating\n that the properties of the SerializedLambda\
            \ are consistent with a\n lambda actually captured by that class.\n\n\
            \ The identity of a function object produced by deserializing the serialized\n\
            \ form is unpredictable, and therefore identity-sensitive operations (such\
            \ as\n reference equality, object locking, and System.identityHashCode()\
            \ may\n produce different results in different implementations, or even\
            \ upon\n different deserializations in the same implementation."
