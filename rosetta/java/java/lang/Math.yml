          notes: "The class Math contains methods for performing basic\n numeric operations\
            \ such as the elementary exponential, logarithm,\n square root, and trigonometric\
            \ functions.\n\n Unlike some of the numeric methods of class\n StrictMath,\
            \ all implementations of the equivalent\n functions of class Math are\
            \ not defined to return the\n bit-for-bit same results.  This relaxation\
            \ permits\n better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility\
            \ is\n not required.\n\n By default many of the Math methods simply call\n\
            \ the equivalent method in StrictMath for their\n implementation.  Code\
            \ generators are encouraged to use\n platform-specific native libraries\
            \ or microprocessor instructions,\n where available, to provide higher-performance\
            \ implementations of\n Math methods.  Such higher-performance\n implementations\
            \ still must conform to the specification for\n Math.\n\n The quality\
            \ of implementation specifications concern two\n properties, accuracy\
            \ of the returned result and monotonicity of the\n method.  Accuracy of\
            \ the floating-point Math methods is\n measured in terms of ulps, units\
            \ in the last place.  For a\n given floating-point format, an ulp of a\n\
            \ specific real number value is the distance between the two\n floating-point\
            \ values bracketing that numerical value.  When\n discussing the accuracy\
            \ of a method as a whole rather than at a\n specific argument, the number\
            \ of ulps cited is for the worst-case\n error at any argument.  If a method\
            \ always has an error less than\n 0.5 ulps, the method always returns\
            \ the floating-point number\n nearest the exact result; such a method\
            \ is correctly\n rounded.  A correctly rounded method is generally the\
            \ best a\n floating-point approximation can be; however, it is impractical\
            \ for\n many floating-point methods to be correctly rounded.  Instead,\
            \ for\n the Math class, a larger error bound of 1 or 2 ulps is\n allowed\
            \ for certain methods.  Informally, with a 1 ulp error bound,\n when the\
            \ exact result is a representable number, the exact result\n should be\
            \ returned as the computed result; otherwise, either of the\n two floating-point\
            \ values which bracket the exact result may be\n returned.  For exact\
            \ results large in magnitude, one of the\n endpoints of the bracket may\
            \ be infinite.  Besides accuracy at\n individual arguments, maintaining\
            \ proper relations between the\n method at different arguments is also\
            \ important.  Therefore, most\n methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors\
            \ are required to be\n semi-monotonic: whenever the mathematical function\
            \ is\n non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise,\n\
            \ whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the\n floating-point\
            \ approximation.  Not all approximations that have 1\n ulp accuracy will\
            \ automatically meet the monotonicity requirements.\n\n \n The platform\
            \ uses signed two's complement integer arithmetic with\n int and long\
            \ primitive types.  The developer should choose\n the primitive type to\
            \ ensure that arithmetic operations consistently\n produce correct results,\
            \ which in some cases means the operations\n will not overflow the range\
            \ of values of the computation.\n The best practice is to choose the primitive\
            \ type and algorithm to avoid\n overflow. In cases where the size is int\
            \ or long and\n overflow errors need to be detected, the methods addExact,\n\
            \ subtractExact, multiplyExact, toIntExact,\n incrementExact, decrementExact\
            \ and negateExact\n throw an ArithmeticException when the results overflow.\n\
            \ For the arithmetic operations divide and absolute value, overflow\n\
            \ occurs only with a specific minimum or maximum value and\n should be\
            \ checked against the minimum or maximum as appropriate.\n\n IEEE 754\
            \ Recommended\n Operations\n\n The 2019 revision of the IEEE 754 floating-point\
            \ standard includes\n a section of recommended operations and the semantics\
            \ of those\n operations if they are included in a programming environment.\
            \ The\n recommended operations present in this class include sin, cos,\
            \ tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, expm1, log, log10, log1p,\n sinh, cosh,\
            \ tanh, hypot, and pow.  (The sqrt\n operation is a required part of IEEE\
            \ 754 from a different section\n of the standard.) The special case behavior\
            \ of the recommended\n operations generally follows the guidance of the\
            \ IEEE 754\n standard. However, the pow method defines different\n behavior\
            \ for some arguments, as noted in its specification. The IEEE 754 standard\
            \ defines its operations to be\n correctly rounded, which is a more stringent\
            \ quality of\n implementation condition than required for most of the\
            \ methods in\n question that are also included in this class."
