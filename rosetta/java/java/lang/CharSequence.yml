          notes: "A CharSequence is a readable sequence of char values. This\n interface\
            \ provides uniform, read-only access to many different kinds of\n char\
            \ sequences.\n A char value represents a character in the Basic\n Multilingual\
            \ Plane (BMP) or a surrogate. Refer to Unicode Character Representation\
            \ for details.\n\n  This interface does not refine the general contracts\
            \ of the equals and hashCode methods. The result of testing two objects\n\
            \ that implement CharSequence for equality is therefore, in general, undefined.\n\
            \ Each object may be implemented by a different class, and there\n is\
            \ no guarantee that each class will be capable of testing its instances\n\
            \ for equality with those of the other.  It is therefore inappropriate\
            \ to use\n arbitrary CharSequence instances as elements in a set or as\
            \ keys in\n a map."

              \ to be a\n sequence of char values, cs[0] to cs[len-1]. Suppose k\n\
              \ is the lowest index at which the corresponding char values from each\
              \ sequence\n differ. The lexicographic ordering of the sequences is\
              \ determined by a numeric\n comparison of the char values cs1[k] with\
              \ cs2[k]. If there is\n no such index k, the shorter sequence is considered\
              \ lexicographically\n less than the other. If the sequences have the\
              \ same length, the sequences are\n considered lexicographically equal."
