          notes: "This is the common base class of all Java language record classes.\n\
            \n More information about records, including descriptions of the\n implicitly\
            \ declared methods synthesized by the compiler, can be\n found in section\
            \ 8.10 of\n The Java Language Specification.\n\n A record class is a shallowly\
            \ immutable, transparent carrier for\n a fixed set of values, called the\
            \ record components.  The Java\n language provides concise syntax for\
            \ declaring record classes, whereby the\n record components are declared\
            \ in the record header.  The list of record\n components declared in the\
            \ record header form the record descriptor.\n\n A record class has the\
            \ following mandated members: a canonical\n constructor, which must provide\
            \ at least as much access as the record\n class and whose descriptor is\
            \ the same as the record descriptor;\n a private final field corresponding\
            \ to each component, whose name and\n type are the same as that of the\
            \ component; a public accessor method\n corresponding to each component,\
            \ whose name and return type are the same as\n that of the component.\
            \  If not explicitly declared in the body of the record,\n implicit implementations\
            \ for these members are provided.\n\n The implicit declaration of the\
            \ canonical constructor has the same accessibility\n as the record class\
            \ and initializes the component fields from the corresponding\n constructor\
            \ arguments.  The implicit declaration of the accessor methods returns\n\
            \ the value of the corresponding component field.  The implicit declaration\
            \ of the\n Object.equals(Object), Object.hashCode(), and Object.toString()\n\
            \ methods are derived from all of the component fields.\n\n The primary\
            \ reasons to provide an explicit declaration for the\n canonical constructor\
            \ or accessor methods are to validate constructor\n arguments, perform\
            \ defensive copies on mutable components, or normalize groups\n of components\
            \ (such as reducing a rational number to lowest terms.)\n\n For all record\
            \ classes, the following invariant must hold: if a record R's\n components\
            \ are c1, c2, ... cn, then if a record instance is copied\n as follows:\n\
            \ \n     R copy = new R(r.c1(), r.c2(), ..., r.cn());\n \n then it must\
            \ be the case that r.equals(copy)."
