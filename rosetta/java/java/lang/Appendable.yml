          notes: "An object to which char sequences and values can be appended.  The\n\
            \ Appendable interface must be implemented by any class whose\n instances\
            \ are intended to receive formatted output from a Formatter.\n\n  The\
            \ characters to be appended should be valid Unicode characters as\n described\
            \ in Unicode Character\n Representation.  Note that supplementary characters\
            \ may be composed of\n multiple 16-bit char values.\n\n  Appendables are\
            \ not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.  Thread\n safety is the\
            \ responsibility of classes that extend and implement this\n interface.\n\
            \n  Since this interface may be implemented by existing classes\n with\
            \ different styles of error handling there is no guarantee that\n errors\
            \ will be propagated to the invoker."
