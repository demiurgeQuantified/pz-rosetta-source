          notes: "Represents a type which is constable.  A constable type is one whose\n\
            \ values are constants that can be represented in the constant pool of\
            \ a Java\n classfile as described in JVMS 4.4, and whose instances can\
            \ describe themselves\n nominally as a ConstantDesc.\n\n Some constable\
            \ types have a native representation in the constant pool:\n String, Integer,\
            \ Long, Float,\n Double, Class, MethodType, and MethodHandle.\n The types\
            \ String, Integer, Long, Float,\n and Double serve as their own nominal\
            \ descriptors; Class,\n MethodType, and MethodHandle have corresponding\
            \ nominal\n descriptors ClassDesc, MethodTypeDesc, and MethodHandleDesc.\n\
            \n Other reference types can be constable if their instances can describe\n\
            \ themselves in nominal form as a ConstantDesc. Examples in the Java SE\n\
            \ Platform API are types that support Java language features such as Enum,\n\
            \ and runtime support classes such as VarHandle.  These are typically\n\
            \ described with a DynamicConstantDesc, which describes dynamically\n\
            \ generated constants (JVMS 4.4.10).\n\n The nominal form of an instance\
            \ of a constable type is obtained via\n describeConstable(). A Constable\
            \ need\n not be able to (or may choose not to) describe all its instances\
            \ in the form of\n a ConstantDesc; this method returns an Optional that\
            \ can be\n empty to indicate that a nominal descriptor could not be created\
            \ for an instance.\n (For example, MethodHandle will produce nominal descriptors\
            \ for direct\n method handles, but not necessarily those produced by method\
            \ handle\n combinators.)"
