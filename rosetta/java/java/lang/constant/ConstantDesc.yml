          notes: "A nominal descriptor for a loadable\n constant value, as defined\
            \ in JVMS 4.4. Such a descriptor can be resolved via\n resolveConstantDesc(MethodHandles.Lookup)\
            \ to yield the\n constant value itself.\n\n Class names in a nominal descriptor,\
            \ like class names in the constant pool\n of a classfile, must be interpreted\
            \ with respect to a particular class\n loader, which is not part of the\
            \ nominal descriptor.\n\n Static constants that are expressible natively\
            \ in the constant pool (String,\n Integer, Long, Float, and Double) implement\n\
            \ ConstantDesc, and serve as nominal descriptors for themselves.\n Native\
            \ linkable constants (Class, MethodType, and\n MethodHandle) have counterpart\
            \ ConstantDesc types:\n ClassDesc, MethodTypeDesc, and MethodHandleDesc.\n\
            \ Other constants are represented by subtypes of DynamicConstantDesc.\n\
            \n APIs that perform generation or parsing of bytecode are encouraged\
            \ to use\n ConstantDesc to describe the operand of an ldc instruction\n\
            \ (including dynamic constants), the static bootstrap arguments of\n dynamic\
            \ constants and invokedynamic instructions, and other\n bytecodes or classfile\
            \ structures that make use of the constant pool.\n\n Constants describing\
            \ various common constants (such as ClassDesc\n instances for platform\
            \ types) can be found in ConstantDescs.\n\n Implementations of ConstantDesc\
            \ should be immutable\n and their behavior should not rely on object identity.\n\
            \n Non-platform classes should not implement ConstantDesc directly.\n\
            \ Instead, they should extend DynamicConstantDesc (as Enum.EnumDesc\n\
            \ and VarHandle.VarHandleDesc do.)\n\n Nominal descriptors should be compared\
            \ using the\n Object.equals(Object) method. There is no guarantee that\
            \ any\n particular entity will always be represented by the same descriptor\
            \ instance."
