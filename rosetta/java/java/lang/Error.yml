          notes: "An Error is a subclass of Throwable\n that indicates serious problems\
            \ that a reasonable application\n should not try to catch. Most such errors\
            \ are abnormal conditions.\n The ThreadDeath error, though a \"normal\"\
            \ condition,\n is also a subclass of Error because most applications\n\
            \ should not try to catch it.\n \n A method is not required to declare\
            \ in its throws\n clause any subclasses of Error that might be thrown\n\
            \ during the execution of the method but not caught, since these\n errors\
            \ are abnormal conditions that should never occur.\n\n That is, Error\
            \ and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked\n exceptions for the purposes\
            \ of compile-time checking of exceptions."
