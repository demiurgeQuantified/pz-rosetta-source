          notes: "The security manager is a class that allows\n applications to implement\
            \ a security policy. It allows an\n application to determine, before performing\
            \ a possibly unsafe or\n sensitive operation, what the operation is and\
            \ whether\n it is being attempted in a security context that allows the\n\
            \ operation to be performed. The\n application can allow or disallow the\
            \ operation.\n \n The SecurityManager class contains many methods with\n\
            \ names that begin with the word check. These methods\n are called by\
            \ various methods in the Java libraries before those\n methods perform\
            \ certain potentially sensitive operations. The\n invocation of such a\
            \ check method typically looks like this:\n \n     SecurityManager security\
            \ = System.getSecurityManager();\n     if (security != null) {\n     \
            \    security.check<i>XXX</i>(argument,  . . . );\n     }\n \n \n The\
            \ security manager is thereby given an opportunity to prevent\n completion\
            \ of the operation by throwing an exception. A security\n manager routine\
            \ simply returns if the operation is permitted, but\n throws a SecurityException\
            \ if the operation is not\n permitted.\n \n Environments using a security\
            \ manager will typically set the security\n manager at startup. In the\
            \ JDK implementation, this is done by setting the\n system property java.security.manager\
            \ on the command line\n to the class name of the security manager. It\
            \ can also be set to the empty\n String (\"\") or the special token \"\
            default\" to use the\n default java.lang.SecurityManager. If a class name\
            \ is specified,\n it must be java.lang.SecurityManager or a public subclass\
            \ and have\n a public no-arg constructor. The class is loaded by the\n\
            \ built-in system class loader\n if it is not java.lang.SecurityManager.\
            \ If the\n java.security.manager system property is not set, the default\
            \ value\n is null, which means a security manager will not be set at startup.\n\
            \ \n The Java run-time may also allow, but is not required to allow, the\
            \ security\n manager to be set dynamically by invoking the\n setSecurityManager\
            \ method.\n In the JDK implementation, if the Java virtual machine is\
            \ started with\n the java.security.manager system property set to the\
            \ special token\n \"disallow\" then a security manager will not be set\
            \ at startup and\n cannot be set dynamically (the\n setSecurityManager\n\
            \ method will throw an UnsupportedOperationException). If the\n java.security.manager\
            \ system property is not set or is set to the\n special token \"allow\"\
            , then a security manager will not be set at\n startup but can be set\
            \ dynamically. Finally, if the\n java.security.manager system property\
            \ is set to the class name of\n the security manager, or to the empty\
            \ String (\"\") or the special token\n \"default\", then a security manager\
            \ is set at startup (as described\n previously) and can also be subsequently\
            \ replaced (or disabled) dynamically\n (subject to the policy of the currently\
            \ installed security manager). The\n following table illustrates the behavior\
            \ of the JDK implementation for the\n different settings of the java.security.manager\
            \ system property:\n \n property value,\n  the SecurityManager set at\
            \ startup,\n  can dynamically set a SecurityManager\n \n \n \n Property\
            \ Value\n The SecurityManager set at startup\n System.setSecurityManager\
            \ run-time behavior\n \n \n \n\n \n   null\n   None\n   Success or throws\
            \ SecurityException if not permitted by\n the currently installed security\
            \ manager\n \n\n \n   empty String (\"\")\n   java.lang.SecurityManager\n\
            \   Success or throws SecurityException if not permitted by\n the currently\
            \ installed security manager\n \n\n \n   \"default\"\n   java.lang.SecurityManager\n\
            \   Success or throws SecurityException if not permitted by\n the currently\
            \ installed security manager\n \n\n \n   \"disallow\"\n   None\n   Always\
            \ throws UnsupportedOperationException\n \n\n \n   \"allow\"\n   None\n\
            \   Success or throws SecurityException if not permitted by\n the currently\
            \ installed security manager\n \n\n \n   a class name\n   the named class\n\
            \   Success or throws SecurityException if not permitted by\n the currently\
            \ installed security manager\n \n\n \n \n  A future release of the JDK\
            \ may change the default value of the\n java.security.manager system property\
            \ to \"disallow\".\n \n The current security manager is returned by the\n\
            \ getSecurityManager method.\n \n The special method\n checkPermission(java.security.Permission)\n\
            \ determines whether an access request indicated by a specified\n permission\
            \ should be granted or denied. The\n default implementation calls\n\n\
            \ \n   AccessController.checkPermission(perm);\n \n\n \n If a requested\
            \ access is allowed,\n checkPermission returns quietly. If denied, a\n\
            \ SecurityException is thrown.\n \n The default implementation of each\
            \ of the other\n check methods in SecurityManager is to\n call the SecurityManager\
            \ checkPermission method\n to determine if the calling thread has permission\
            \ to perform the requested\n operation.\n \n Note that the checkPermission\
            \ method with\n just a single permission argument always performs security\
            \ checks\n within the context of the currently executing thread.\n Sometimes\
            \ a security check that should be made within a given context\n will actually\
            \ need to be done from within a\n different context (for example, from\
            \ within a worker thread).\n The getSecurityContext method\n and the checkPermission\n\
            \ method that includes a context argument are provided\n for this situation.\
            \ The\n getSecurityContext method returns a \"snapshot\"\n of the current\
            \ calling context. (The default implementation\n returns an AccessControlContext\
            \ object.) A sample call is\n the following:\n\n \n   Object context =\
            \ null;\n   SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();\n   if (sm\
            \ != null) context = sm.getSecurityContext();\n \n\n \n The checkPermission\
            \ method\n that takes a context object in addition to a permission\n makes\
            \ access decisions based on that context,\n rather than on that of the\
            \ current execution thread.\n Code within a different context can thus\
            \ call that method,\n passing the permission and the\n previously-saved\
            \ context object. A sample call, using the\n SecurityManager sm obtained\
            \ as in the previous example,\n is the following:\n\n \n   if (sm != null)\
            \ sm.checkPermission(permission, context);\n \n\n Permissions fall into\
            \ these categories: File, Socket, Net,\n Security, Runtime, Property,\
            \ AWT, Reflect, and Serializable.\n The classes managing these various\n\
            \ permission categories are java.io.FilePermission,\n java.net.SocketPermission,\n\
            \ java.net.NetPermission,\n java.security.SecurityPermission,\n java.lang.RuntimePermission,\n\
            \ java.util.PropertyPermission,\n java.awt.AWTPermission,\n java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission,\
            \ and\n java.io.SerializablePermission.\n\n All but the first two (FilePermission\
            \ and SocketPermission) are\n subclasses of java.security.BasicPermission,\
            \ which itself\n is an abstract subclass of the\n top-level class for\
            \ permissions, which is\n java.security.Permission. BasicPermission defines\
            \ the\n functionality needed for all permissions that contain a name\n\
            \ that follows the hierarchical property naming convention\n (for example,\
            \ \"exitVM\", \"setFactory\", \"queuePrintJob\", etc).\n An asterisk\n\
            \ may appear at the end of the name, following a \".\", or by itself,\
            \ to\n signify a wildcard match. For example: \"a.*\" or \"*\" is valid,\n\
            \ \"*a\" or \"a*b\" is not valid.\n\n FilePermission and SocketPermission\
            \ are subclasses of the\n top-level class for permissions\n (java.security.Permission).\
            \ Classes like these\n that have a more complicated name syntax than that\
            \ used by\n BasicPermission subclass directly from Permission rather than\
            \ from\n BasicPermission. For example,\n for a java.io.FilePermission\
            \ object, the permission name is\n the path name of a file (or directory).\n\
            \n Some of the permission classes have an \"actions\" list that tells\n\
            \ the actions that are permitted for the object.  For example,\n for a\
            \ java.io.FilePermission object, the actions list\n (such as \"read, write\"\
            ) specifies which actions are granted for the\n specified file (or for\
            \ files in the specified directory).\n\n Other permission classes are\
            \ for \"named\" permissions -\n ones that contain a name but no actions\
            \ list; you either have the\n named permission or you don't.\n\n Note:\
            \ There is also a java.security.AllPermission\n permission that implies\
            \ all permissions. It exists to simplify the work\n of system administrators\
            \ who might need to perform multiple\n tasks that require all (or numerous)\
            \ permissions.\n \n See Permissions in the Java Development Kit (JDK)\n\
            \ for permission-related information.\n This document includes a table\
            \ listing the various SecurityManager\n check methods and the permission(s)\
            \ the default\n implementation of each such method requires.\n It also\
            \ contains a table of the methods\n that require permissions, and for\
            \ each such method tells\n which permission it requires."
