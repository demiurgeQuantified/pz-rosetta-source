          notes: "The Double class wraps a value of the primitive type\n double in\
            \ an object. An object of type\n Double contains a single field whose\
            \ type is\n double.\n\n In addition, this class provides several methods\
            \ for converting a\n double to a String and a\n String to a double, as\
            \ well as other\n constants and methods useful when dealing with a\n double.\n\
            \n This is a value-based\n class; programmers should treat instances that\
            \ are\n equal as interchangeable and should not\n use instances for synchronization,\
            \ or unpredictable behavior may\n occur. For example, in a future release,\
            \ synchronization may fail.\n\n Floating-point Equality, Equivalence,\n\
            \ and Comparison\n\n IEEE 754 floating-point values include finite nonzero\
            \ values,\n signed zeros (+0.0 and -0.0), signed infinities\n positive\
            \ infinity and\n negative infinity), and\n NaN (not-a-number).\n\n An\
            \ equivalence relation on a set of values is a boolean\n relation on pairs\
            \ of values that is reflexive, symmetric, and\n transitive. For more discussion\
            \ of equivalence relations and object\n equality, see the Object.equals\n\
            \ specification. An equivalence relation partitions the values it\n operates\
            \ over into sets called equivalence classes.  All the\n members of the\
            \ equivalence class are equal to each other under the\n relation. An equivalence\
            \ class may contain only a single member. At\n least for some purposes,\
            \ all the members of an equivalence class\n are substitutable for each\
            \ other.  In particular, in a numeric\n expression equivalent values can\
            \ be substituted for one\n another without changing the result of the\
            \ expression, meaning\n changing the equivalence class of the result of\
            \ the expression.\n\n Notably, the built-in == operation on floating-point\n\
            \ values is not an equivalence relation. Despite not\n defining an equivalence\
            \ relation, the semantics of the IEEE 754\n == operator were deliberately\
            \ designed to meet other needs\n of numerical computation. There are two\
            \ exceptions where the\n properties of an equivalence relation are not\
            \ satisfied by \n == on floating-point values:\n\n \n\n If v1 and v2 are\
            \ both NaN, then v1\n == v2 has the value false. Therefore, for two NaN\n\
            \ arguments the reflexive property of an equivalence\n relation is not\
            \ satisfied by the == operator.\n\n If v1 represents +0.0 while v2\n represents\
            \ -0.0, or vice versa, then v1 == v2 has\n the value true even though\
            \ +0.0 and -0.0\n are distinguishable under various floating-point operations.\
            \ For\n example, 1.0/+0.0 evaluates to positive infinity while\n 1.0/-0.0\
            \ evaluates to negative infinity and\n positive infinity and negative\
            \ infinity are neither equal to each\n other nor equivalent to each other.\
            \ Thus, while a signed zero input\n most commonly determines the sign\
            \ of a zero result, because of\n dividing by zero, +0.0 and -0.0 may not\
            \ be\n substituted for each other in general. The sign of a zero input\n\
            \ also has a non-substitutable effect on the result of some math\n library\
            \ methods.\n\n \n\n For ordered comparisons using the built-in comparison\
            \ operators\n (<, <=, etc.), NaN values have another anomalous\n situation:\
            \ a NaN is neither less than, nor greater than, nor equal\n to any value,\
            \ including itself. This means the trichotomy of\n comparison does not\
            \ hold.\n\n To provide the appropriate semantics for equals and\n compareTo\
            \ methods, those methods cannot simply be wrappers\n around == or ordered\
            \ comparison operations. Instead, equals defines NaN arguments to be equal\
            \ to each\n other and defines +0.0 to not be equal to \n -0.0, restoring\
            \ reflexivity. For comparisons, compareTo defines a total order where\
            \ \n -0.0 is less than +0.0 and where a NaN is equal to itself\n and considered\
            \ greater than positive infinity.\n\n The operational semantics of equals\
            \ and \n compareTo are expressed in terms of bit-wise converting the floating-point\
            \ values to integral values.\n\n The natural ordering implemented by compareTo\
            \ is consistent with equals. That\n is, two objects are reported as equal\
            \ by equals if and only\n if compareTo on those objects returns zero.\n\
            \n The adjusted behaviors defined for equals and \n compareTo allow instances\
            \ of wrapper classes to work properly with\n conventional data structures.\
            \ For example, defining NaN\n values to be equals to one another allows\
            \ NaN to be used as\n an element of a HashSet or as the key of\n a HashMap.\
            \ Similarly, defining \n compareTo as a total ordering, including +0.0,\
            \ \n -0.0, and NaN, allows instances of wrapper classes to be used as\n\
            \ elements of a SortedSet or as keys of a\n SortedMap."
