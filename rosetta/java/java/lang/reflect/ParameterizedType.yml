          notes: "ParameterizedType represents a parameterized type such as\n Collection<String>.\n\
            \n A parameterized type is created the first time it is needed by a\n\
            \ reflective method, as specified in this package. When a\n parameterized\
            \ type p is created, the generic class or interface declaration\n that\
            \ p instantiates is resolved, and all type arguments of p are created\n\
            \ recursively. See TypeVariable for details on the creation process for\
            \ type\n variables. Repeated creation of a parameterized type has no effect.\n\
            \n Instances of classes that implement this interface must implement\n\
            \ an equals() method that equates any two instances that share the\n same\
            \ generic class or interface declaration and have equal type parameters."
