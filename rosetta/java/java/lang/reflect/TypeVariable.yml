          notes: "TypeVariable is the common superinterface for type variables of\
            \ kinds.\n A type variable is created the first time it is needed by a\
            \ reflective\n method, as specified in this package.  If a type variable\
            \ t is referenced\n by a type (i.e, class, interface or annotation type)\
            \ T, and T is declared\n by the nth enclosing class of T (see JLS 8.1.2),\
            \ then the creation of t\n requires the resolution (see JVMS 5) of the\
            \ ith enclosing class of T,\n for i = 0 to n, inclusive. Creating a type\
            \ variable must not cause the\n creation of its bounds. Repeated creation\
            \ of a type variable has no effect.\n\n Multiple objects may be instantiated\
            \ at run-time to\n represent a given type variable. Even though a type\
            \ variable is\n created only once, this does not imply any requirement\
            \ to cache\n instances representing the type variable. However, all instances\n\
            \ representing a type variable must be equal() to each other.\n As a consequence,\
            \ users of type variables must not rely on the identity\n of instances\
            \ of classes implementing this interface."
