          notes: "The AccessibleObject class is the base class for Field,\n Method,\
            \ and Constructor objects (known as reflected\n objects). It provides\
            \ the ability to flag a reflected object as\n suppressing checks for Java\
            \ language access control when it is used. This\n permits sophisticated\
            \ applications with sufficient privilege, such as Java\n Object Serialization\
            \ or other persistence mechanisms, to manipulate objects\n in a manner\
            \ that would normally be prohibited.\n\n  Java language access control\
            \ prevents use of private members outside\n their top-level class; package\
            \ access members outside their package; protected members\n outside their\
            \ package or subclasses; and public members outside their\n module unless\
            \ they are declared in an exported package and the user reads their module.\
            \ By\n default, Java language access control is enforced (with one variation)\
            \ when\n Fields, Methods, or Constructors are used to get or\n set fields,\
            \ to invoke methods, or to create and initialize new instances of\n classes,\
            \ respectively. Every reflected object checks that the code using it\n\
            \ is in an appropriate class, package, or module. The check when invoked\
            \ by\n JNI code with no Java\n class on the stack only succeeds if the\
            \ member and the declaring class are\n public, and the class is in a package\
            \ that is exported to all modules. \n\n  The one variation from Java language\
            \ access control is that the checks\n by reflected objects assume readability.\
            \ That is, the module containing\n the use of a reflected object is assumed\
            \ to read the module in which\n the underlying field, method, or constructor\
            \ is declared. \n\n  Whether the checks for Java language access control\
            \ can be suppressed\n (and thus, whether access can be enabled) depends\
            \ on whether the reflected\n object corresponds to a member in an exported\
            \ or open package\n (see setAccessible(boolean))."
