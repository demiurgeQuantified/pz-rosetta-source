          notes: "AnnotatedType represents the potentially annotated use of a type\
            \ in\n the program currently running in this VM. The use may be of any\
            \ type in the\n Java programming language, including an array type, a\
            \ parameterized type, a\n type variable, or a wildcard type.\n\n Note\
            \ that any annotations returned by methods on this interface are\n type\
            \ annotations (JLS 9.7.4) as the entity being\n potentially annotated\
