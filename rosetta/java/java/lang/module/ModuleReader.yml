          notes: "Provides access to the content of a module.\n\n  A module reader\
            \ is intended for cases where access to the resources in a\n module is\
            \ required, regardless of whether the module has been loaded.\n A framework\
            \ that scans a collection of packaged modules on the file system,\n for\
            \ example, may use a module reader to access a specific resource in each\n\
            \ module. A module reader is also intended to be used by ClassLoader\n\
            \ implementations that load classes and resources from modules. \n\n \
            \ A resource in a module is identified by an abstract name that is a\n\
            \ '/'-separated path string. For example, module java.base may\n have\
            \ a resource \"java/lang/Object.class\" that, by convention, is the\n\
            \ class file for java.lang.Object. A module reader may treat\n directories\
            \ in the module content as resources (whether it does or not is\n module\
            \ reader specific). Where the module content contains a directory\n that\
            \ can be located as a resource then its name ends with a slash ('/').\
            \ The\n directory can also be located with a name that drops the trailing\
            \ slash. \n\n  A ModuleReader is open upon\n creation and is closed by\
            \ invoking the close method.  Failure\n to close a module reader may result\
            \ in a resource leak.  The \n try-with-resources statement provides a\
            \ useful construct to ensure that\n module readers are closed. \n\n  A\
            \ ModuleReader implementation may require permissions to access\n resources\
            \ in the module. Consequently the find, open, read, and list methods may\
            \ throw \n SecurityException if access is denied by the security manager."
