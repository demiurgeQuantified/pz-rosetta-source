          notes: "The common interface extended by all annotation interfaces.  Note\
            \ that an\n interface that manually extends this one does not define\n\
            \ an annotation interface.  Also note that this interface does not itself\n\
            \ define an annotation interface.\n\n More information about annotation\
            \ interfaces can be found in section\n 9.6 of The Java Language Specification.\n\
            \n The AnnotatedElement interface discusses\n compatibility concerns when\
            \ evolving an annotation interface from being\n non-repeatable to being\
            \ repeatable."
