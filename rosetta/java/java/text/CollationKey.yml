          notes: "A CollationKey represents a String under the\n rules of a specific\
            \ Collator object. Comparing two\n CollationKeys returns the relative\
            \ order of the\n Strings they represent. Using CollationKeys\n to compare\
            \ Strings is generally faster than using\n Collator.compare. Thus, when\
            \ the Strings\n must be compared multiple times, for example when sorting\
            \ a list\n of Strings. It's more efficient to use CollationKeys.\n\n \n\
            \ You can not create CollationKeys directly. Rather,\n generate them by\
            \ calling Collator.getCollationKey.\n You can only compare CollationKeys\
            \ generated from\n the same Collator object.\n\n \n Generating a CollationKey\
            \ for a String\n involves examining the entire String\n and converting\
            \ it to series of bits that can be compared bitwise. This\n allows fast\
            \ comparisons once the keys are generated. The cost of generating\n keys\
            \ is recouped in faster comparisons when Strings need\n to be compared\
            \ many times. On the other hand, the result of a comparison\n is often\
            \ determined by the first couple of characters of each String.\n Collator.compare\
            \ examines only as many characters as it needs which\n allows it to be\
            \ faster when doing single comparisons.\n \n The following example shows\
            \ how CollationKeys might be used\n to sort a list of Strings.\n \n <code>\n\
            \ // Create an array of CollationKeys for the Strings to be sorted.\n\
            \ Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();\n CollationKey[] keys\
            \ = new CollationKey[3];\n keys[0] = myCollator.getCollationKey(\"Tom\"\
            );\n keys[1] = myCollator.getCollationKey(\"Dick\");\n keys[2] = myCollator.getCollationKey(\"\
            Harry\");\n sort(keys);\n\n //...\n\n // Inside body of sort routine,\
            \ compare keys this way\n if (keys[i].compareTo(keys[j]) > 0)\n    //\
            \ swap keys[i] and keys[j]\n\n //...\n\n // Finally, when we've returned\
            \ from sort.\n System.out.println(keys[0].getSourceString());\n System.out.println(keys[1].getSourceString());\n\
            \ System.out.println(keys[2].getSourceString());\n </code>"
