          notes: "An AttributedCharacterIterator allows iteration through both text\
            \ and\n related attribute information.\n\n \n An attribute is a key/value\
            \ pair, identified by the key.  No two\n attributes on a given character\
            \ can have the same key.\n\n The values for an attribute are immutable,\
            \ or must not be mutated\n by clients or storage.  They are always passed\
            \ by reference, and not\n cloned.\n\n A run with respect to an attribute\
            \ is a maximum text range for\n which:\n \n the attribute is undefined\
            \ or null for the entire range, or\n the attribute value is defined and\
            \ has the same non-null value for the\n     entire range.\n \n\n A run\
            \ with respect to a set of attributes is a maximum text range for\n which\
            \ this condition is met for each member attribute.\n\n When getting a\
            \ run with no explicit attributes specified (i.e.,\n calling getRunStart()\
            \ and getRunLimit()), any\n contiguous text segments having the same attributes\
            \ (the same set\n of attribute/value pairs) are treated as separate runs\
            \ if the\n attributes have been given to those text segments separately.\n\
            \n The returned indexes are limited to the range of the iterator.\n\n\
            \ The returned attribute information is limited to runs that contain\n\
            \ the current character.\n\n \n Attribute keys are instances of AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute\
            \ and its\n subclasses, such as TextAttribute."
