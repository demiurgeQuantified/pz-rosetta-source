          notes: "The BreakIterator class implements methods for finding\n the location\
            \ of boundaries in text. Instances of BreakIterator\n maintain a current\
            \ position and scan over text\n returning the index of characters where\
            \ boundaries occur.\n Internally, BreakIterator scans text using a\n CharacterIterator,\
            \ and is thus able to scan text held\n by any object implementing that\
            \ protocol. A StringCharacterIterator\n is used to scan String objects\
            \ passed to setText.\n\n \n You use the factory methods provided by this\
            \ class to create\n instances of various types of break iterators. In\
            \ particular,\n use getWordInstance, getLineInstance,\n getSentenceInstance,\
            \ and getCharacterInstance\n to create BreakIterators that perform\n word,\
            \ line, sentence, and character boundary analysis respectively.\n A single\
            \ BreakIterator can work only on one unit\n (word, line, sentence, and\
            \ so on). You must use a different iterator\n for each unit boundary analysis\
            \ you wish to perform.\n\n \n Line boundary analysis determines where\
            \ a text string can be\n broken when line-wrapping. The mechanism correctly\
            \ handles\n punctuation and hyphenated words. Actual line breaking needs\n\
            \ to also consider the available line width and is handled by\n higher-level\
            \ software.\n\n \n Sentence boundary analysis allows selection with correct\
            \ interpretation\n of periods within numbers and abbreviations, and trailing\
            \ punctuation\n marks such as quotation marks and parentheses.\n\n \n\
            \ Word boundary analysis is used by search and replace functions, as\n\
            \ well as within text editing applications that allow the user to\n select\
            \ words with a double click. Word selection provides correct\n interpretation\
            \ of punctuation marks within and following\n words. Characters that are\
            \ not part of a word, such as symbols\n or punctuation marks, have word-breaks\
            \ on both sides.\n\n \n Character boundary analysis allows users to interact\
            \ with characters\n as they expect to, for example, when moving the cursor\
            \ through a text\n string. Character boundary analysis provides correct\
            \ navigation\n through character strings, regardless of how the character\
            \ is stored.\n The boundaries returned may be those of supplementary characters,\n\
            \ combining character sequences, or ligature clusters.\n For example,\
            \ an accented character might be stored as a base character\n and a diacritical\
            \ mark. What users consider to be a character can\n differ between languages.\n\
            \n \n The BreakIterator instances returned by the factory methods\n of\
            \ this class are intended for use with natural languages only, not for\n\
            \ programming language text. It is however possible to define subclasses\n\
            \ that tokenize a programming language.\n\n \n Examples:\n Creating and\

            \ boundary = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();\n          boundary.setText(stringToExamine);\n\
            \          printEachForward(boundary, stringToExamine);\n          //print\
            \ each sentence in reverse order\n          boundary = BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(Locale.US);\n\
            \          boundary.setText(stringToExamine);\n          printEachBackward(boundary,\
            \ stringToExamine);\n          printFirst(boundary, stringToExamine);\n\

            \ {\n     int end = boundary.last();\n     for (int start = boundary.previous();\n\
            \          start != BreakIterator.DONE;\n          end = start, start\
            \ = boundary.previous()) {\n         System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));\n\
            \     }\n }\n \n \n\n Print first element:\n \n \n public static void\
            \ printFirst(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {\n     int start\
            \ = boundary.first();\n     int end = boundary.next();\n     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));\n\
            \ }\n \n \n\n Print last element:\n \n \n public static void printLast(BreakIterator\
            \ boundary, String source) {\n     int end = boundary.last();\n     int\
            \ start = boundary.previous();\n     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));\n\
            \ }\n \n \n\n Print the element at a specified position:\n \n \n public\
            \ static void printAt(BreakIterator boundary, int pos, String source)\
            \ {\n     int end = boundary.following(pos);\n     int start = boundary.previous();\n\
            \     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));\n }\n \n \n\n Find\
            \ the next word:\n \n <code>\n public static int nextWordStartAfter(int\
            \ pos, String text) {\n     BreakIterator wb = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();\n\
            \     wb.setText(text);\n     int last = wb.following(pos);\n     int\
            \ current = wb.next();\n     while (current != BreakIterator.DONE) {\n\
            \         for (int p = last; p < current; p++) {\n             if (Character.isLetter(text.codePointAt(p)))\n\
            \                 return last;\n         }\n         last = current;\n\
            \         current = wb.next();\n     }\n     return BreakIterator.DONE;\n\
            \ }\n </code>\n (The iterator returned by BreakIterator.getWordInstance()\
            \ is unique in that\n the break positions it returns don't represent both\
            \ the start and end of the\n thing being iterated over.  That is, a sentence-break\
            \ iterator returns breaks\n that each represent the end of one sentence\
            \ and the beginning of the next.\n With the word-break iterator, the characters\
            \ between two boundaries might be a\n word, or they might be the punctuation\
            \ or whitespace between two words.  The\n above code uses a simple heuristic\
            \ to determine which boundary is the beginning\n of a word: If the characters\
            \ between this boundary and the next boundary\n include at least one letter\
            \ (this can be an alphabetical letter, a CJK ideograph,\n a Hangul syllable,\
            \ a Kana character, etc.), then the text between this boundary\n and the\
            \ next is a word; otherwise, it's the material between words.)"
