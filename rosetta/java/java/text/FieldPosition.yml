          notes: "FieldPosition is a simple class used by Format\n and its subclasses\
            \ to identify fields in formatted output. Fields can\n be identified in\
            \ two ways:\n \n  By an integer constant, whose names typically end with\n\
            \      _FIELD. The constants are defined in the various\n      subclasses\
            \ of Format.\n  By a Format.Field constant, see ERA_FIELD\n      and its\
            \ friends in DateFormat for an example.\n \n \n FieldPosition keeps track\
            \ of the position of the\n field within the formatted output with two\
            \ indices: the index\n of the first character of the field and the index\
            \ of the last\n character of the field.\n\n \n One version of the format\
            \ method in the various\n Format classes requires a FieldPosition\n object\
            \ as an argument. You use this format method\n to perform partial formatting\
            \ or to get information about the\n formatted output (such as the position\
            \ of a field).\n\n \n If you are interested in the positions of all attributes\
            \ in the\n formatted string use the Format method\n formatToCharacterIterator."
