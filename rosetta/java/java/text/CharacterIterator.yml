          notes: "This interface defines a protocol for bidirectional iteration over\
            \ text.\n The iterator iterates over a bounded sequence of characters.\
            \  Characters\n are indexed with values beginning with the value returned\
            \ by getBeginIndex() and\n continuing through the value returned by getEndIndex()-1.\n\
            \ \n Iterators maintain a current character index, whose valid range is\
            \ from\n getBeginIndex() to getEndIndex(); the value getEndIndex() is\
            \ included to allow\n handling of zero-length text ranges and for historical\
            \ reasons.\n The current index can be retrieved by calling getIndex()\
            \ and set directly\n by calling setIndex(), first(), and last().\n \n\
            \ The methods previous() and next() are used for iteration. They return\
            \ DONE if\n they would move outside the range from getBeginIndex() to\
            \ getEndIndex() -1,\n signaling that the iterator has reached the end\
            \ of the sequence. DONE is\n also returned by other methods to indicate\
            \ that the current index is\n outside this range.\n\n Examples:\n\n Traverse\
            \ the text from start to finish\n <code>\n public void traverseForward(CharacterIterator\
            \ iter) {\n     for(char c = iter.first(); c != CharacterIterator.DONE;\
            \ c = iter.next()) {\n         processChar(c);\n     }\n }\n </code>\n\
            \n Traverse the text backwards, from end to start\n <code>\n public void\
            \ traverseBackward(CharacterIterator iter) {\n     for(char c = iter.last();\
            \ c != CharacterIterator.DONE; c = iter.previous()) {\n         processChar(c);\n\
            \     }\n }\n </code>\n\n Traverse both forward and backward from a given\
            \ position in the text.\n Calls to notBoundary() in this example represents\
            \ some\n additional stopping criteria.\n <code>\n public void traverseOut(CharacterIterator\
            \ iter, int pos) {\n     for (char c = iter.setIndex(pos);\n         \
            \     c != CharacterIterator.DONE && notBoundary(c);\n              c\
            \ = iter.next()) {\n     }\n     int end = iter.getIndex();\n     for\
            \ (char c = iter.setIndex(pos);\n             c != CharacterIterator.DONE\
            \ && notBoundary(c);\n             c = iter.previous()) {\n     }\n  \
            \   int start = iter.getIndex();\n     processSection(start, end);\n }\n\
