          notes: "Immutable arbitrary-precision integers.  All operations behave as\
            \ if\n BigIntegers were represented in two's-complement notation (like\
            \ Java's\n primitive integer types).  BigInteger provides analogues to\
            \ all of Java's\n primitive integer operators, and all relevant methods\
            \ from java.lang.Math.\n Additionally, BigInteger provides operations\
            \ for modular arithmetic, GCD\n calculation, primality testing, prime\
            \ generation, bit manipulation,\n and a few other miscellaneous operations.\n\
            \n Semantics of arithmetic operations exactly mimic those of Java's integer\n\
            \ arithmetic operators, as defined in The Java Language Specification.\n\
            \ For example, division by zero throws an ArithmeticException, and\n division\
            \ of a negative by a positive yields a negative (or zero) remainder.\n\
            \n Semantics of shift operations extend those of Java's shift operators\n\
            \ to allow for negative shift distances.  A right-shift with a negative\n\
            \ shift distance results in a left shift, and vice-versa.  The unsigned\n\
            \ right shift operator (>>>) is omitted since this operation\n only makes\
            \ sense for a fixed sized word and not for a\n representation conceptually\
            \ having an infinite number of leading\n virtual sign bits.\n\n Semantics\
            \ of bitwise logical operations exactly mimic those of Java's\n bitwise\
            \ integer operators.  The binary operators (and,\n or, xor) implicitly\
            \ perform sign extension on the shorter\n of the two operands prior to\
            \ performing the operation.\n\n Comparison operations perform signed integer\
            \ comparisons, analogous to\n those performed by Java's relational and\
            \ equality operators.\n\n Modular arithmetic operations are provided to\
            \ compute residues, perform\n exponentiation, and compute multiplicative\
            \ inverses.  These methods always\n return a non-negative result, between\
            \ 0 and (modulus - 1),\n inclusive.\n\n Bit operations operate on a single\
            \ bit of the two's-complement\n representation of their operand.  If necessary,\
            \ the operand is sign-extended\n so that it contains the designated bit.\
            \  None of the single-bit\n operations can produce a BigInteger with a\
            \ different sign from the\n BigInteger being operated on, as they affect\
            \ only a single bit, and the\n arbitrarily large abstraction provided\
            \ by this class ensures that conceptually\n there are infinitely many\
            \ \"virtual sign bits\" preceding each BigInteger.\n\n For the sake of\
            \ brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used throughout the\n descriptions\
            \ of BigInteger methods.  The pseudo-code expression\n (i + j) is shorthand\
            \ for \"a BigInteger whose value is\n that of the BigInteger i plus that\
            \ of the BigInteger j.\"\n The pseudo-code expression (i == j) is shorthand\
            \ for\n \"true if and only if the BigInteger i represents the same\n value\
            \ as the BigInteger j.\"  Other pseudo-code expressions are\n interpreted\
            \ similarly.\n\n All methods and constructors in this class throw\n NullPointerException\
            \ when passed\n a null object reference for any input parameter.\n\n BigInteger\
            \ must support values in the range\n -2Integer.MAX_VALUE (exclusive) to\n\
            \ +2Integer.MAX_VALUE (exclusive)\n and may support values outside of\
            \ that range.\n\n An ArithmeticException is thrown when a BigInteger\n\
            \ constructor or method would generate a value outside of the\n supported\
            \ range.\n\n The range of probable prime values is limited and may be\
            \ less than\n the full supported positive range of BigInteger.\n The range\
            \ must be at least 1 to 2500000000."
