          notes: "This class represents access to a network via sockets.\n A SocketPermission\
            \ consists of a\n host specification and a set of \"actions\" specifying\
            \ ways to\n connect to that host. The host is specified as\n \n    host\
            \ = (hostname | IPv4address | iPv6reference) [:portrange]\n    portrange\
            \ = portnumber | -portnumber | portnumber-[portnumber]\n \n The host is\
            \ expressed as a DNS name, as a numerical IP address,\n or as \"localhost\"\
            \ (for the local machine).\n The wildcard \"*\" may be included once in\
            \ a DNS name host\n specification. If it is included, it must be in the\
            \ leftmost\n position, as in \"*.example.com\".\n \n The format of the\
            \ IPv6reference should follow that specified in RFC 2732: Format\n for\
            \ Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs:\n \n    ipv6reference = \"[\" IPv6address\
            \ \"]\"\n\n For example, you can construct a SocketPermission instance\n\
            \ as the following:\n \n    String hostAddress = inetaddress.getHostAddress();\n\
            \    if (inetaddress instanceof Inet6Address) {\n        sp = new SocketPermission(\"\
            [\" + hostAddress + \"]:\" + port, action);\n    } else {\n        sp\
            \ = new SocketPermission(hostAddress + \":\" + port, action);\n    }\n\
            \ \n or\n \n    String host = url.getHost();\n    sp = new SocketPermission(host\
            \ + \":\" + port, action);\n \n \n The full uncompressed form of\n an\
            \ IPv6 literal address is also valid.\n \n The port or portrange is optional.\
            \ A port specification of the\n form \"N-\", where N is a port number,\
            \ signifies all ports\n numbered N and above, while a specification of\
            \ the\n form \"-N\" indicates all ports numbered N and below.\n The special\
            \ port value 0 refers to the entire ephemeral\n port range. This is a\
            \ fixed range of ports a system may use to\n allocate dynamic ports from.\
            \ The actual range may be system dependent.\n \n The possible ways to\
            \ connect to the host are\n \n accept\n connect\n listen\n resolve\n \n\
            \ The \"listen\" action is only meaningful when used with \"localhost\"\
            \ and\n means the ability to bind to a specified port.\n The \"resolve\"\
            \ action is implied when any of the other actions are present.\n The action\
            \ \"resolve\" refers to host/ip name service lookups.\n \n The actions\
            \ string is converted to lowercase before processing.\n As an example\
            \ of the creation and meaning of SocketPermissions,\n note that if the\
            \ following permission:\n\n \n   p1 = new SocketPermission(\"foo.example.com:7777\"\
            , \"connect,accept\");\n \n\n is granted to some code, it allows that\
            \ code to connect to port 7777 on\n foo.example.com, and to accept connections\
            \ on that port.\n\n Similarly, if the following permission:\n\n \n   p2\
            \ = new SocketPermission(\"localhost:1024-\", \"accept,connect,listen\"\
            );\n \n\n is granted to some code, it allows that code to\n accept connections\
            \ on, connect to, or listen on any port between\n 1024 and 65535 on the\
            \ local host.\n\n Note: Granting code permission to accept or make connections\
            \ to remote\n hosts may be dangerous because malevolent code can then\
            \ more easily\n transfer and share confidential data among parties who\
            \ may not\n otherwise have access to the data."
