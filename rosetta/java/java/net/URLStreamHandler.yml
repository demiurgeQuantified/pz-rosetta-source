          notes: "The abstract class URLStreamHandler is the common\n superclass for\
            \ all stream protocol handlers. A stream protocol\n handler knows how\
            \ to make a connection for a particular protocol\n type, such as http\
            \ or https.\n \n In most cases, an instance of a URLStreamHandler\n subclass\
            \ is not created directly by an application. Rather, the\n first time\
            \ a protocol name is encountered when constructing a\n URL, the appropriate\
            \ stream protocol handler is\n automatically loaded."
