          notes: "This class implements an IP Socket Address (IP address + port number)\n\
            \ It can also be a pair (hostname + port number), in which case an attempt\n\
            \ will be made to resolve the hostname. If resolution fails then the address\n\
            \ is said to be unresolved but can still be used on some circumstances\n\
            \ like connecting through a proxy.\n \n It provides an immutable object\
            \ used by sockets for binding, connecting, or\n as returned values.\n\
            \ \n The wildcard is a special local IP address. It usually means \"any\"\
            \n and can only be used for bind operations."
