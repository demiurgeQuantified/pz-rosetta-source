          notes: "The abstract class URLConnection is the superclass\n of all classes\
            \ that represent a communications link between the\n application and a\
            \ URL. Instances of this class can be used both to\n read from and to\
            \ write to the resource referenced by the URL.\n\n \n In general, creating\
            \ a connection to a URL is a multistep process:\n \n The connection object\
            \ is created by invoking the\n     openConnection method on a URL.\n The\
            \ setup parameters and general request properties are manipulated.\n The\
            \ actual connection to the remote object is made, using the\n    connect\
            \ method.\n The remote object becomes available. The header fields and\
            \ the contents\n     of the remote object can be accessed.\n \n \n The\
            \ setup parameters are modified using the following methods:\n \n   setAllowUserInteraction\n\
            \   setDoInput\n   setDoOutput\n   setIfModifiedSince\n   setUseCaches\n\
            \ \n \n and the general request properties are modified using the method:\n\
            \ \n   setRequestProperty\n \n \n Default values for the AllowUserInteraction\
            \ and\n UseCaches parameters can be set using the methods\n setDefaultAllowUserInteraction\
            \ and\n setDefaultUseCaches.\n \n Each of the above set methods has a\
            \ corresponding\n get method to retrieve the value of the parameter or\n\
            \ general request property. The specific parameters and general\n request\
            \ properties that are applicable are protocol specific.\n \n The following\
            \ methods are used to access the header fields and\n the contents after\
            \ the connection is made to the remote object:\n \n   getContent\n   getHeaderField\n\
            \   getInputStream\n   getOutputStream\n \n \n Certain header fields are\
            \ accessed frequently. The methods:\n \n   getContentEncoding\n   getContentLength\n\
            \   getContentType\n   getDate\n   getExpiration\n   getLastModified\n\
            \ \n \n provide convenient access to these fields. The\n getContentType\
            \ method is used by the\n getContent method to determine the type of the\
            \ remote\n object; subclasses may find it convenient to override the\n\
            \ getContentType method.\n \n In the common case, all of the pre-connection\
            \ parameters and\n general request properties can be ignored: the pre-connection\n\
            \ parameters and request properties default to sensible values. For\n\
            \ most clients of this interface, there are only two interesting\n methods:\
            \ getInputStream and getContent,\n which are mirrored in the URL class\
            \ by convenience methods.\n \n More information on the request properties\
            \ and header fields of\n an http connection can be found at:\n \n <a href=\"\
            http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt\">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt</a>\n\
            \ \n\n Invoking the close() methods on the InputStream or OutputStream\
            \ of an\n URLConnection after a request may free network resources associated\
            \ with this\n instance, unless particular protocol specifications specify\
            \ different behaviours\n for it."
