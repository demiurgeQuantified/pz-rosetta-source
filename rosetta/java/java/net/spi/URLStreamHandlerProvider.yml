          notes: "URL stream handler service-provider class.\n\n  A URL stream handler\
            \ provider is a concrete subclass of this class that\n has a zero-argument\
            \ constructor. URL stream handler providers may be\n installed in an instance\
            \ of the Java platform by adding them to the\n application class path.\n\
            \n  A URL stream handler provider identifies itself with a\n provider-configuration\
            \ file named java.net.spi.URLStreamHandlerProvider in\n the resource directory\
            \ META-INF/services. The file should contain a list of\n fully-qualified\
            \ concrete URL stream handler provider class names, one per\n line.\n\n\
            \  URL stream handler providers are located at runtime, as specified in\
