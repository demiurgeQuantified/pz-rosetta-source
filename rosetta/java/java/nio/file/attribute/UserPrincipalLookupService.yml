          notes: "An object to lookup user and group principals by name. A UserPrincipal\n\
            \ represents an identity that may be used to determine access rights to\
            \ objects\n in a file system. A GroupPrincipal represents a group identity.\n\
            \ A UserPrincipalLookupService defines methods to lookup identities by\n\
            \ name or group name (which are typically user or account names). Whether\
            \ names\n and group names are case sensitive or not depends on the implementation.\n\
            \ The exact definition of a group is implementation specific but typically\
            \ a\n group represents an identity created for administrative purposes\
            \ so as to\n determine the access rights for the members of the group.\
            \ In particular it is\n implementation specific if the namespace for names\
            \ and groups is the\n same or is distinct. To ensure consistent and correct\
            \ behavior across\n platforms it is recommended that this API be used\
            \ as if the namespaces are\n distinct. In other words, the lookupPrincipalByName\
            \ should be used to lookup users, and lookupPrincipalByGroupName should\
            \ be used to\n lookup groups."
