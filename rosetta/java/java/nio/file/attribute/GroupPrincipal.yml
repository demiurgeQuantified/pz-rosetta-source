          notes: "A UserPrincipal representing a group identity, used to\n determine\
            \ access rights to objects in a file system. The exact definition of\n\
            \ a group is implementation specific, but typically, it represents an\
            \ identity\n created for administrative purposes so as to determine the\
            \ access rights for\n the members of the group. Whether an entity can\
            \ be a member of multiple\n groups, and whether groups can be nested,\
            \ are implementation specified and\n therefore not specified."
