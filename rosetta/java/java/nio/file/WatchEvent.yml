          notes: "An event or a repeated event for an object that is registered with\
            \ a WatchService.\n\n  An event is classified by its kind and has a count\
            \ to indicate the number of times that the event has been\n observed.\
            \ This allows for efficient representation of repeated events. The\n context\
            \ method returns any context associated with\n the event. In the case\
            \ of a repeated event then the context is the same for\n all events.\n\
            \n  Watch events are immutable and safe for use by multiple concurrent\n\
            \ threads."
