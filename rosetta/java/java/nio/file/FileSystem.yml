          notes: "Provides an interface to a file system and is the factory for objects\
            \ to\n access files and other objects in the file system.\n\n  The default\
            \ file system, obtained by invoking the FileSystems.getDefault method,\
            \ provides access to the file system that is\n accessible to the Java\
            \ virtual machine. The FileSystems class defines\n methods to create file\
            \ systems that provide access to other types of (custom)\n file systems.\n\
            \n  A file system is the factory for several types of objects:\n\n \n\
            \    The getPath method converts a system dependent\n     path string,\
            \ returning a Path object that may be used\n     to locate and access\
            \ a file. \n    The getPathMatcher method is used\n     to create a PathMatcher\
            \ that performs match operations on\n     paths. \n    The getFileStores\
            \ method returns an iterator\n     over the underlying file-stores. \n\
            \    The getUserPrincipalLookupService\n     method returns the UserPrincipalLookupService\
            \ to lookup users or\n     groups by name. \n    The newWatchService method\
            \ creates a\n     WatchService that may be used to watch objects for changes\
            \ and\n     events. \n \n\n  File systems vary greatly. In some cases\
            \ the file system is a single\n hierarchy of files with one top-level\
            \ root directory. In other cases it may\n have several distinct file hierarchies,\
            \ each with its own top-level root\n directory. The getRootDirectories\
            \ method may be\n used to iterate over the root directories in the file\
            \ system. A file system\n is typically composed of one or more underlying\
            \ file-stores\n that provide the storage for the files. Theses file stores\
            \ can also vary in\n the features they support, and the file attributes\
            \ or meta-data that\n they associate with files.\n\n  A file system is\
            \ open upon creation and can be closed by invoking its\n close method.\
            \ Once closed, any further attempt to access\n objects in the file system\
            \ cause ClosedFileSystemException to be\n thrown. File systems created\
            \ by the default provider\n cannot be closed.\n\n  A FileSystem can provide\
            \ read-only or read-write access to the\n file system. Whether or not\
            \ a file system provides read-only access is\n established when the FileSystem\
            \ is created and can be tested by invoking\n its isReadOnly method. Attempts\
            \ to write to file stores\n by means of an object associated with a read-only\
            \ file system throws ReadOnlyFileSystemException.\n\n  File systems are\
            \ safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The close method may be\
            \ invoked at any time to close a file system but\n whether a file system\
            \ is asynchronously closeable is provider specific\n and therefore unspecified.\
            \ In other words, if a thread is accessing an\n object in a file system,\
            \ and another thread invokes the close method\n then it may require to\
            \ block until the first operation is complete. Closing\n a file system\
            \ causes all open channels, watch services, and other closeable objects\
            \ associated with the file system to be closed."

              \  *.java\n   Matches a path that represents a file name ending in .java\n\
              \ \n \n   *.*\n   Matches file names containing a dot\n \n \n   *.{java,class}\n\
              \   Matches file names ending with .java or .class\n \n \n   foo.?\n\
              \   Matches file names starting with foo. and a single\n   character\
              \ extension\n \n \n   &#47;home&#47;*&#47;*\n   Matches &#47;home&#47;gus&#47;data\
              \ on UNIX platforms\n \n \n   &#47;home&#47;**\n   Matches &#47;home&#47;gus\
              \ and\n   &#47;home&#47;gus&#47;data on UNIX platforms\n \n \n   C:&#92;&#92;*\n\
              \   Matches C:&#92;foo and C:&#92;bar on the Windows\n   platform (note\
              \ that the backslash is escaped; as a string literal in the\n   Java\
              \ Language the pattern would be \"C:&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;*\") \n \n \n\
              \ \n\n  The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:\n\n\
              \ \n    The * character matches zero or more characters of a name component\
              \ without\n   crossing directory boundaries. \n\n    The ** characters\
              \ matches zero or more characters crossing directory boundaries. \n\n\
              \    The ? character matches exactly one character of a\n   name component.\n\
              \n    The backslash character (\\) is used to escape characters\n  \
              \ that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression\n\
              \   \\\\ matches a single backslash and \"\\{\" matches a left brace\n\
              \   for example.  \n\n    The [ ] characters are a bracket expression\
              \ that\n   match a single character of a name component out of a set\
              \ of characters.\n   For example, [abc] matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"\
              c\".\n   The hyphen (-) may be used to specify a range so [a-z]\n  \
              \ specifies a range that matches from \"a\" to \"z\" (inclusive).\n\
              \   These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches \"a\", \"b\",\n   \"\
              c\", \"e\", \"f\" or \"g\". If the character\n   after the [ is a !\
              \ then it is used for negation so \n   [!a-c] matches any character\
              \ except \"a\", \"b\", or \n   \"c\".\n    Within a bracket expression\
              \ the *, ? and \\\n   characters match themselves. The (-) character\
              \ matches itself if\n   it is the first character within the brackets,\
              \ or the first character\n   after the ! if negating.\n\n    The { }\
              \ characters are a group of subpatterns, where\n   the group matches\
              \ if any subpattern in the group matches. The \",\"\n   character is\
              \ used to separate the subpatterns. Groups cannot be nested.\n   \n\n\
              \    Leading period&#47;dot characters in file name are\n   treated\
              \ as regular characters in match operations. For example,\n   the \"\
              *\" glob pattern matches file name \".login\".\n   The Files.isHidden(java.nio.file.Path)\
              \ method may be used to test whether a file\n   is considered hidden.\n\
              \   \n\n    All other characters match themselves in an implementation\n\
              \   dependent manner. This includes characters representing any name-separators.\
              \ \n\n    The matching of root components is highly\n   implementation-dependent\
              \ and is not specified. \n\n \n\n  When the syntax is \"regex\" then\
              \ the pattern component is a\n regular expression as defined by the\
              \ Pattern\n class.\n\n   For both the glob and regex syntaxes, the matching\
              \ details, such as\n whether the matching is case sensitive, are implementation-dependent\n\
              \ and therefore not specified."
