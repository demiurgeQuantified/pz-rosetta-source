          notes: "A token representing the registration of a watchable object\n with\
            \ a WatchService.\n\n  A watch key is created when a watchable object\
            \ is registered with a watch\n service. The key remains valid until:\n\
            \ \n    It is cancelled, explicitly, by invoking its cancel\n     method,\
            \ or\n    Cancelled implicitly, because the object is no longer accessible,\n\
            \     or \n    By closing the watch service. \n \n\n  A watch key has\
            \ a state. When initially created the key is said to be\n ready. When\
            \ an event is detected then the key is signalled\n and queued so that\
            \ it can be retrieved by invoking the watch service's poll or take methods.\
            \ Once\n signalled, a key remains in this state until its reset method\n\
            \ is invoked to return the key to the ready state. Events detected while\
            \ the\n key is in the signalled state are queued but do not cause the\
            \ key to be\n re-queued for retrieval from the watch service. Events are\
            \ retrieved by\n invoking the key's pollEvents method. This method\n retrieves\
            \ and removes all events accumulated for the object. When initially\n\
            \ created, a watch key has no pending events. Typically events are retrieved\n\
            \ when the key is in the signalled state leading to the following idiom:\n\
            \n \n     for (;;) {\n         // retrieve key\n         WatchKey key\
            \ = watcher.take();\n\n         // process events\n         for (WatchEvent<?>\
            \ event: key.pollEvents()) {\n             :\n         }\n\n         //\
            \ reset the key\n         boolean valid = key.reset();\n         if (!valid)\
            \ {\n             // object no longer registered\n         }\n     }\n\
            \ \n\n  Watch keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. Where\
            \ there\n are several threads retrieving signalled keys from a watch service\
            \ then care\n should be taken to ensure that the reset method is only\
            \ invoked after\n the events for the object have been processed. This\
            \ ensures that one thread\n is processing the events for an object at\
            \ any time."
