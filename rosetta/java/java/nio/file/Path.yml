          notes: "An object that may be used to locate a file in a file system. It\
            \ will\n typically represent a system dependent file path.\n\n  A Path\
            \ represents a path that is hierarchical and composed of a\n sequence\
            \ of directory and file name elements separated by a special separator\n\
            \ or delimiter. A root component, that identifies a file system\n hierarchy,\
            \ may also be present. The name element that is farthest\n from the root\
            \ of the directory hierarchy is the name of a file or directory.\n The\
            \ other name elements are directory names. A Path can represent a\n root,\
            \ a root and a sequence of names, or simply one or more name elements.\n\
            \ A Path is considered to be an empty path if it consists\n solely of\
            \ one name element that is empty. Accessing a file using an\n empty path\
            \ is equivalent to accessing the default directory of the\n file system.\
            \ Path defines the getFileName,\n getParent, getRoot, and subpath methods\
            \ to access the path components or a subsequence of its name\n elements.\n\
            \n  In addition to accessing the components of a path, a Path also\n defines\
            \ the resolve and resolveSibling methods to combine paths. The relativize\n\
            \ method that can be used to construct a relative path between two paths.\n\
            \ Paths can be compared, and tested against each other using\n the startsWith\
            \ and endsWith methods.\n\n  This interface extends Watchable interface\
            \ so that a directory\n located by a path can be registered with a WatchService\
            \ and entries in the directory watched. \n\n  WARNING: This interface\
            \ is only intended to be implemented by\n those developing custom file\
            \ system implementations. Methods may be added to\n this interface in\
            \ future releases. \n\n Accessing Files\n  Paths may be used with the\
            \ Files class to operate on files,\n directories, and other types of files.\
            \ For example, suppose we want a BufferedReader to read text from a file\
            \ \"access.log\". The\n file is located in a directory \"logs\" relative\
            \ to the current working\n directory and is UTF-8 encoded.\n \n     Path\
            \ path = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath(\"logs\", \"access.log\");\n\
            \     BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n\
            \ \n\n Interoperability\n  Paths associated with the default provider\
            \ are generally interoperable\n with the java.io.File class. Paths created\
            \ by other\n providers are unlikely to be interoperable with the abstract\
            \ path names\n represented by java.io.File. The toPath\n method may be\
            \ used to obtain a Path from the abstract path name\n represented by a\
            \ java.io.File object. The resulting Path can\n be used to operate on\
            \ the same file as the java.io.File object. In\n addition, the toFile\
            \ method is useful to construct a \n File from the String representation\
            \ of a Path.\n\n Concurrency\n  Implementations of this interface are\
            \ immutable and safe for use by\n multiple concurrent threads."
