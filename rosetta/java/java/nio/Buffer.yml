          notes: "A container for data of a specific primitive type.\n\n  A buffer\
            \ is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific\n primitive type.\
            \  Aside from its content, the essential properties of a\n buffer are\
            \ its capacity, limit, and position: \n\n \n\n    A buffer's capacity\
            \ is the number of elements it contains.  The\n   capacity of a buffer\
            \ is never negative and never changes.  \n\n    A buffer's limit is the\
            \ index of the first element that should\n   not be read or written. \
            \ A buffer's limit is never negative and is never\n   greater than its\
            \ capacity.  \n\n    A buffer's position is the index of the next element\
            \ to be\n   read or written.  A buffer's position is never negative and\
            \ is never\n   greater than its limit.  \n\n \n\n  There is one subclass\
            \ of this class for each non-boolean primitive type.\n\n\n  Transferring\
            \ data \n\n  Each subclass of this class defines two categories of get\
            \ and\n put operations: \n\n \n\n    Relative operations read or write\
            \ one or more elements starting\n   at the current position and then increment\
            \ the position by the number of\n   elements transferred.  If the requested\
            \ transfer exceeds the limit then a\n   relative get operation throws\
            \ a BufferUnderflowException\n   and a relative put operation throws a\
            \ BufferOverflowException; in either case, no data is transferred.  \n\
            \n    Absolute operations take an explicit element index and do not\n\
            \   affect the position.  Absolute get and put operations throw\n   an\
            \ IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index argument exceeds the\n   limit.\
            \  \n\n \n\n  Data may also, of course, be transferred in to or out of\
            \ a buffer by the\n I/O operations of an appropriate channel, which are\
            \ always relative to the\n current position.\n\n\n  Marking and resetting\
            \ \n\n  A buffer's mark is the index to which its position will be reset\n\
            \ when the reset method is invoked.  The mark is not always\n defined,\
            \ but when it is defined it is never negative and is never greater\n than\
            \ the position.  If the mark is defined then it is discarded when the\n\
            \ position or the limit is adjusted to a value smaller than the mark.\
            \  If the\n mark is not defined then invoking the reset method causes\
            \ an\n InvalidMarkException to be thrown.\n\n\n  Invariants \n\n  The\
            \ following invariant holds for the mark, position, limit, and\n capacity\
            \ values:\n\n \n     0 <=\n     mark <=\n     position <=\n     limit\
            \ <=\n     capacity\n \n\n  A newly-created buffer always has a position\
            \ of zero and a mark that is\n undefined.  The initial limit may be zero,\
            \ or it may be some other value\n that depends upon the type of the buffer\
            \ and the manner in which it is\n constructed.  Each element of a newly-allocated\
            \ buffer is initialized\n to zero.\n\n\n  Additional operations \n\n \
            \ In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity\n\
            \ values and for marking and resetting, this class also defines the following\n\
            \ operations upon buffers:\n\n \n\n    clear() makes a buffer ready for\
            \ a new sequence of\n   channel-read or relative put operations: It sets\
            \ the limit to the\n   capacity and the position to zero.  \n\n    flip()\
            \ makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of\n   channel-write or relative\
            \ get operations: It sets the limit to the\n   current position and then\
            \ sets the position to zero.  \n\n    rewind() makes a buffer ready for\
            \ re-reading the data that\n   it already contains: It leaves the limit\
            \ unchanged and sets the position\n   to zero.  \n\n    The slice() and\
            \ slice(index,length)\n   methods create a subsequence of a buffer: They\
            \ leave the limit and the\n   position unchanged. \n\n    duplicate()\
            \ creates a shallow copy of a buffer: It leaves\n   the limit and the\
            \ position unchanged. \n\n \n\n\n  Read-only buffers \n\n  Every buffer\
            \ is readable, but not every buffer is writable.  The\n mutation methods\
            \ of each buffer class are specified as optional\n operations that will\
            \ throw a ReadOnlyBufferException when\n invoked upon a read-only buffer.\
            \  A read-only buffer does not allow its\n content to be changed, but\
            \ its mark, position, and limit values are mutable.\n Whether or not a\
            \ buffer is read-only may be determined by invoking its\n isReadOnly method.\n\
            \n\n  Thread safety \n\n  Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent\
            \ threads.  If a\n buffer is to be used by more than one thread then access\
            \ to the buffer\n should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.\n\
            \n\n  Invocation chaining \n\n  Methods in this class that do not otherwise\
            \ have a value to return are\n specified to return the buffer upon which\
            \ they are invoked.  This allows\n method invocations to be chained; for\
            \ example, the sequence of statements\n\n \n b.flip();\n b.position(23);\n\
            \ b.limit(42);\n\n can be replaced by the single, more compact statement\n\
            \n \n b.flip().position(23).limit(42);"
