          notes: "A direct byte buffer whose content is a memory-mapped region of\
            \ a file.\n\n  Mapped byte buffers are created via the FileChannel.map\
            \ method.  This class\n extends the ByteBuffer class with operations that\
            \ are specific to\n memory-mapped file regions.\n\n  A mapped byte buffer\
            \ and the file mapping that it represents remain\n valid until the buffer\
            \ itself is garbage-collected.\n\n  The content of a mapped byte buffer\
            \ can change at any time, for example\n if the content of the corresponding\
            \ region of the mapped file is changed by\n this program or another. \
            \ Whether or not such changes occur, and when they\n occur, is operating-system\
            \ dependent and therefore unspecified.\n\n  All or part of a mapped byte\
            \ buffer may become\n inaccessible at any time, for example if the mapped\
            \ file is truncated.  An\n attempt to access an inaccessible region of\
            \ a mapped byte buffer will not\n change the buffer's content and will\
            \ cause an unspecified exception to be\n thrown either at the time of\
            \ the access or at some later time.  It is\n therefore strongly recommended\
            \ that appropriate precautions be taken to\n avoid the manipulation of\
            \ a mapped file by this program, or by a\n concurrently running program,\
            \ except to read or write the file's content.\n\n  Mapped byte buffers\
            \ otherwise behave no differently than ordinary direct\n byte buffers."
