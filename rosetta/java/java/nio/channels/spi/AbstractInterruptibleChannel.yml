          notes: "Base implementation class for interruptible channels.\n\n  This\
            \ class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement\n the\
            \ asynchronous closing and interruption of channels.  A concrete channel\n\
            \ class must invoke the begin and end methods\n before and after, respectively,\
            \ invoking an I/O operation that might block\n indefinitely.  In order\
            \ to ensure that the end method is always\n invoked, these methods should\
            \ be used within a\n try ... finally block:\n\n \n boolean completed =\
            \ false;\n try {\n     begin();\n     completed = ...;    // Perform blocking\
            \ I/O operation\n     return ...;         // Return result\n } finally\
            \ {\n     end(completed);\n }\n\n  The completed argument to the end method\
            \ tells\n whether or not the I/O operation actually completed, that is,\
            \ whether it had\n any effect that would be visible to the invoker.  In\
            \ the case of an\n operation that reads bytes, for example, this argument\
            \ should be\n true if, and only if, some bytes were actually transferred\
            \ into the\n invoker's target buffer.\n\n  A concrete channel class must\
            \ also implement the implCloseChannel method in such a way that if it\
            \ is\n invoked while another thread is blocked in a native I/O operation\
            \ upon the\n channel then that operation will immediately return, either\
            \ by throwing an\n exception or by returning normally.  If a thread is\
            \ interrupted or the\n channel upon which it is blocked is asynchronously\
            \ closed then the channel's\n end method will throw the appropriate exception.\n\
            \n  This class performs the synchronization required to implement the\
            \ Channel specification.  Implementations of the implCloseChannel method\
            \ need not synchronize against\n other threads that might be attempting\
            \ to close the channel."
