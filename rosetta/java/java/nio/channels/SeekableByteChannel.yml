          notes: "A byte channel that maintains a current position and allows the\n\
            \ position to be changed.\n\n  A seekable byte channel is connected to\
            \ an entity, typically a file,\n that contains a variable-length sequence\
            \ of bytes that can be read and\n written. The current position can be\
            \ queried and\n modified. The channel also provides access to\n the current\
            \ size of the entity to which the channel is connected. The\n size increases\
            \ when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size\n decreases\
            \ when it is truncated.\n\n  The position and truncate methods\n which\
            \ do not otherwise have a value to return are specified to return the\n\
            \ channel upon which they are invoked. This allows method invocations\
            \ to be\n chained. Implementations of this interface should specialize\
            \ the return type\n so that method invocations on the implementation class\
            \ can be chained."
