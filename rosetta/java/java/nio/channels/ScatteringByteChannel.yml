          notes: "A channel that can read bytes into a sequence of buffers.\n\n  A\
            \ scattering read operation reads, in a single invocation, a\n sequence\
            \ of bytes into one or more of a given sequence of buffers.\n Scattering\
            \ reads are often useful when implementing network protocols or\n file\
            \ formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one\n\
            \ or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar\n\
            \ gathering write operations are defined in the GatheringByteChannel interface."

              \     + ... + dsts[offset+length-1].remaining()\n\n at the moment that\
              \ this method is invoked.\n\n  Suppose that a byte sequence of length\
              \ n is read, where\n 0 <= n <= r.\n Up to the first dsts[offset].remaining()\
              \ bytes of this sequence\n are transferred into buffer dsts[offset],\

              \ into buffer\n dsts[offset+1], and so forth, until the entire byte\
              \ sequence\n is transferred into the given buffers.  As many bytes as\
              \ possible are\n transferred into each buffer, hence the final position\
