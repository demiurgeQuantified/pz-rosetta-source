          notes: "A handler for consuming the result of an asynchronous I/O operation.\n\
            \n  The asynchronous channels defined in this package allow a completion\n\
            \ handler to be specified to consume the result of an asynchronous operation.\n\
            \ The completed method is invoked when the I/O operation\n completes successfully.\
            \ The failed method is invoked if the\n I/O operations fails. The implementations\
            \ of these methods should complete\n in a timely manner so as to avoid\
            \ keeping the invoking thread from dispatching\n to other completion handlers."
