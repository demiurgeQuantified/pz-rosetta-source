          notes: "A token representing a lock on a region of a file.\n\n  A file-lock\
            \ object is created each time a lock is acquired on a file via\n one of\
            \ the lock or tryLock methods of the\n FileChannel class, or the lock\n\
            \ or tryLock\n methods of the AsynchronousFileChannel class.\n\n  A file-lock\
            \ object is initially valid.  It remains valid until the lock\n is released\
            \ by invoking the release method, by closing the\n channel that was used\
            \ to acquire it, or by the termination of the Java\n virtual machine,\
            \ whichever comes first.  The validity of a lock may be\n tested by invoking\
            \ its isValid method.\n\n  A file lock is either exclusive or shared.\
            \  A shared lock\n prevents other concurrently-running programs from acquiring\
            \ an overlapping\n exclusive lock, but does allow them to acquire overlapping\
            \ shared locks.  An\n exclusive lock prevents other programs from acquiring\
            \ an overlapping lock of\n either type.  Once it is released, a lock has\
            \ no further effect on the locks\n that may be acquired by other programs.\n\
            \n  Whether a lock is exclusive or shared may be determined by invoking\
            \ its\n isShared method.  Some platforms do not support shared\n locks,\
            \ in which case a request for a shared lock is automatically converted\n\
            \ into a request for an exclusive lock.\n\n  The locks held on a particular\
            \ file by a single Java virtual machine do\n not overlap.  The overlaps\
            \ method may be used to test\n whether a candidate lock range overlaps\
            \ an existing lock.\n\n  A file-lock object records the file channel upon\
            \ whose file the lock is\n held, the type and validity of the lock, and\
            \ the position and size of the\n locked region.  Only the validity of\
            \ a lock is subject to change over time;\n all other aspects of a lock's\
            \ state are immutable.\n\n  File locks are held on behalf of the entire\
            \ Java virtual machine.\n They are not suitable for controlling access\
            \ to a file by multiple\n threads within the same virtual machine.\n\n\
            \  File-lock objects are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.\n\
            \n\n  Platform dependencies \n\n  This file-locking API is intended to\
            \ map directly to the native locking\n facility of the underlying operating\
            \ system.  Thus the locks held on a file\n should be visible to all programs\
            \ that have access to the file, regardless\n of the language in which\
            \ those programs are written.\n\n  Whether or not a lock actually prevents\
            \ another program from accessing\n the content of the locked region is\
            \ system-dependent and therefore\n unspecified.  The native file-locking\
            \ facilities of some systems are merely\n advisory, meaning that programs\
            \ must cooperatively observe a known\n locking protocol in order to guarantee\
            \ data integrity.  On other systems\n native file locks are mandatory,\
            \ meaning that if one program locks a\n region of a file then other programs\
            \ are actually prevented from accessing\n that region in a way that would\
            \ violate the lock.  On yet other systems,\n whether native file locks\
            \ are advisory or mandatory is configurable on a\n per-file basis.  To\
            \ ensure consistent and correct behavior across platforms,\n it is strongly\
            \ recommended that the locks provided by this API be used as if\n they\
            \ were advisory locks.\n\n  On some systems, acquiring a mandatory lock\
            \ on a region of a file\n prevents that region from being mapped into\
            \ memory, and vice versa.  Programs that combine\n locking and mapping\
            \ should be prepared for this combination to fail.\n\n  On some systems,\
            \ closing a channel releases all locks held by the Java\n virtual machine\
            \ on the underlying file regardless of whether the locks were\n acquired\
            \ via that channel or via another channel open on the same file.  It\n\
            \ is strongly recommended that, within a program, a unique channel be\
            \ used to\n acquire all locks on any given file.\n\n  Some network filesystems\
            \ permit file locking to be used with\n memory-mapped files only when\
            \ the locked regions are page-aligned and a\n whole multiple of the underlying\
            \ hardware's page size.  Some network\n filesystems do not implement file\
            \ locks on regions that extend past a\n certain position, often 230 or\
            \ 231.  In general, great\n care should be taken when locking files that\
            \ reside on network filesystems."
