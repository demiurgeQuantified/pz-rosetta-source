          notes: "A channel that can write bytes from a sequence of buffers.\n\n \
            \ A gathering write operation writes, in a single invocation, a\n sequence\
            \ of bytes from one or more of a given sequence of buffers.\n Gathering\
            \ writes are often useful when implementing network protocols or\n file\
            \ formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one\n\
            \ or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar\n\
            \ scattering read operations are defined in the ScatteringByteChannel\
            \ interface."

              \ in the specified\n subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,\n\

              \     + ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()\n\n at the moment that\
              \ this method is invoked.\n\n  Suppose that a byte sequence of length\
              \ n is written, where\n 0 <= n <= r.\n Up to the first srcs[offset].remaining()\
              \ bytes of this sequence\n are written from buffer srcs[offset], up\
              \ to the next\n srcs[offset+1].remaining() bytes are written from buffer\n\
              \ srcs[offset+1], and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is\n\
              \ written.  As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer,\
              \ hence\n the final position of each updated buffer, except the last\
              \ updated\n buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit.\n\
              \n  Unless otherwise specified, a write operation will return only after\n\
              \ writing all of the r requested bytes.  Some types of channels,\n depending\
              \ upon their state, may write only some of the bytes or possibly\n none\
              \ at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot\n\
              \ write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer.\n\
              \n  This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has\n\
              \ already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then\
              \ an\n invocation of this method will block until the first operation\
