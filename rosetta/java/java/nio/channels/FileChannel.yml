          notes: "A channel for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.\n\
            \n  A file channel is a SeekableByteChannel that is connected to\n a file.\
            \ It has a current position within its file which can\n be both queried\
            \ and modified.  The file itself contains a variable-length sequence\n\
            \ of bytes that can be read and written and whose current size can be\
            \ queried.  The size of the file increases\n when bytes are written beyond\
            \ its current size; the size of the file\n decreases when it is truncated.\
            \  The\n file may also have some associated metadata such as access\n\
            \ permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does\
            \ not\n define methods for metadata access.\n\n  In addition to the familiar\
            \ read, write, and close operations of byte\n channels, this class defines\
            \ the following file-specific operations: \n\n \n\n    Bytes may be read\
            \ or\n   written at an absolute\n   position in a file in a way that does\
            \ not affect the channel's current\n   position.  \n\n    A region of\
            \ a file may be mapped\n   directly into memory; for large files this\
            \ is often much more efficient\n   than invoking the usual read or write\
            \ methods.\n   \n\n    Updates made to a file may be forced\n   out to\
            \ the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not\n   lost in\
            \ the event of a system crash.  \n\n    Bytes can be transferred from\
            \ a file to\n   some other channel, and vice\n   versa, in a way that\
            \ can be optimized by many operating systems\n   into a very fast transfer\
            \ directly to or from the filesystem cache.\n   \n\n    A region of a\
            \ file may be locked\n   against access by other programs.  \n\n \n\n\
            \  File channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  The\n\
            \ close method may be invoked at any time, as specified\n by the Channel\
            \ interface.  Only one operation that involves the\n channel's position\
            \ or can change its file's size may be in progress at any\n given time;\
            \ attempts to initiate a second such operation while the first is\n still\
            \ in progress will block until the first operation completes.  Other\n\
            \ operations, in particular those that take an explicit position, may\
            \ proceed\n concurrently; whether they in fact do so is dependent upon\
            \ the underlying\n implementation and is therefore unspecified.\n\n  The\
            \ view of a file provided by an instance of this class is guaranteed\n\
            \ to be consistent with other views of the same file provided by other\n\
            \ instances in the same program.  The view provided by an instance of\
            \ this\n class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views seen\
            \ by other\n concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by\
            \ the underlying\n operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem\
            \ protocols.  This\n is true regardless of the language in which these\
            \ other programs are\n written, and whether they are running on the same\
            \ machine or on some other\n machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies\
            \ are system-dependent\n and are therefore unspecified.\n\n  A file channel\
            \ is created by invoking one of the open\n methods defined by this class.\
            \ A file channel can also be obtained from an\n existing FileInputStream,\
            \ FileOutputStream, or RandomAccessFile object by invoking\n that object's\
            \ getChannel method, which returns a file channel that\n is connected\
            \ to the same underlying file. Where the file channel is obtained\n from\
            \ an existing stream or random access file then the state of the file\n\
            \ channel is intimately connected to that of the object whose getChannel\n\
            \ method returned the channel.  Changing the channel's position, whether\n\
            \ explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will change the file position\
            \ of\n the originating object, and vice versa. Changing the file's length\
            \ via the\n file channel will change the length seen via the originating\
            \ object, and vice\n versa.  Changing the file's content by writing bytes\
            \ will change the content\n seen by the originating object, and vice versa.\n\
            \n   At various points this class specifies that an\n instance that is\
            \ \"open for reading,\" \"open for writing,\" or \"open for\n reading\
            \ and writing\" is required.  A channel obtained via the getChannel method\
            \ of a FileInputStream instance will be open for reading.  A channel\n\
            \ obtained via the getChannel\n method of a FileOutputStream instance\
            \ will be open for\n writing.  Finally, a channel obtained via the getChannel\
            \ method of a RandomAccessFile instance will be open for reading if the\
            \ instance\n was created with mode \"r\" and will be open for reading\
            \ and writing\n if the instance was created with mode \"rw\".\n\n  A file\
            \ channel that is open for writing may be in\n append mode, for example\
            \ if it was obtained from a file-output stream\n that was created by invoking\
            \ the FileOutputStream(File,boolean) constructor and passing true for\n\
            \ the second parameter.  In this mode each invocation of a relative write\n\
            \ operation first advances the position to the end of the file and then\
            \ writes\n the requested data.  Whether the advancement of the position\
            \ and the writing\n of the data are done in a single atomic operation\
            \ is system-dependent and\n therefore unspecified."
