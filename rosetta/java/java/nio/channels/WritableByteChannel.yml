          notes: "A channel that can write bytes.\n\n  Only one write operation upon\
            \ a writable channel may be in progress at\n any given time.  If one thread\
            \ initiates a write operation upon a channel\n then any other thread that\
            \ attempts to initiate another write operation will\n block until the\
            \ first operation is complete.  Whether or not other kinds of\n I/O operations\
            \ may proceed concurrently with a write operation depends upon\n the type\
            \ of the channel."

            notes: "Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.\n\
              \n  An attempt is made to write up to r bytes to the channel,\n where\
              \ r is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,\n src.remaining(),\
              \ at the moment this method is invoked.\n\n  Suppose that a byte sequence\
              \ of length n is written, where\n 0 <= n <= r.\n This byte sequence\
              \ will be transferred from the buffer starting at index\n p, where p\
              \ is the buffer's position at the moment this\n method is invoked; the\
              \ index of the last byte written will be\n p + n - 1.\n Upon return\
              \ the buffer's position will be equal to\n p + n; its limit will not\
              \ have changed.\n\n  Unless otherwise specified, a write operation will\
              \ return only after\n writing all of the r requested bytes.  Some types\
              \ of channels,\n depending upon their state, may write only some of\
              \ the bytes or possibly\n none at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking\
              \ mode, for example, cannot\n write any more bytes than are free in\
              \ the socket's output buffer.\n\n  This method may be invoked at any\
              \ time.  If another thread has\n already initiated a write operation\
              \ upon this channel, however, then an\n invocation of this method will\
              \ block until the first operation is\n complete."
