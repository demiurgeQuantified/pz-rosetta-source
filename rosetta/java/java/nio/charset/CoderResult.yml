          notes: "A description of the result state of a coder.\n\n  A charset coder,\
            \ that is, either a decoder or an encoder, consumes bytes\n (or characters)\
            \ from an input buffer, translates them, and writes the\n resulting characters\
            \ (or bytes) to an output buffer.  A coding process\n terminates for one\
            \ of four categories of reasons, which are described by\n instances of\
            \ this class:\n\n \n\n    Underflow is reported when there is no more\
            \ input to be\n   processed, or there is insufficient input and additional\
            \ input is\n   required.  This condition is represented by the unique\
            \ result object\n   UNDERFLOW, whose isUnderflow method\n   returns true.\
            \  \n\n    Overflow is reported when there is insufficient room\n   remaining\
            \ in the output buffer.  This condition is represented by the\n   unique\
            \ result object OVERFLOW, whose isOverflow method returns true.  \n\n\
            \    A malformed-input error is reported when a sequence of\n   input\
            \ units is not well-formed.  Such errors are described by instances of\n\
            \   this class whose isMalformed method returns\n   true and whose length\
            \ method returns the length\n   of the malformed sequence.  There is one\
            \ unique instance of this class for\n   all malformed-input errors of\
            \ a given length.  \n\n    An unmappable-character error is reported when\
            \ a sequence\n   of input units denotes a character that cannot be represented\
            \ in the\n   output charset.  Such errors are described by instances of\
            \ this class\n   whose isUnmappable method returns true and\n   whose\
            \ length method returns the length of the input\n   sequence denoting\
            \ the unmappable character.  There is one unique instance\n   of this\
            \ class for all unmappable-character errors of a given length.\n   \n\n\
            \ \n\n  For convenience, the isError method returns true\n for result\
            \ objects that describe malformed-input and unmappable-character\n errors\
            \ but false for those that describe underflow or overflow\n conditions."
