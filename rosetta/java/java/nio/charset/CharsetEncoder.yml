          notes: "An engine that can transform a sequence of sixteen-bit Unicode characters\
            \ into a sequence of\n bytes in a specific charset.\n\n \n\n  The input\
            \ character sequence is provided in a character buffer or a series\n of\
            \ such buffers.  The output byte sequence is written to a byte buffer\n\
            \ or a series of such buffers.  An encoder should always be used by making\n\
            \ the following sequence of method invocations, hereinafter referred to\
            \ as an\n encoding operation:\n\n \n\n    Reset the encoder via the reset\
            \ method, unless it\n   has not been used before; \n\n    Invoke the encode\
            \ method zero or more times, as\n   long as additional input may be available,\
            \ passing false for the\n   endOfInput argument and filling the input\
            \ buffer and flushing the\n   output buffer between invocations; \n\n\
            \    Invoke the encode method one final time, passing\n   true for the\
            \ endOfInput argument; and then \n\n    Invoke the flush method so that\
            \ the encoder can\n   flush any internal state to the output buffer. \n\
            \n \n\n Each invocation of the encode method will encode as many\n characters\
            \ as possible from the input buffer, writing the resulting bytes\n to\
            \ the output buffer.  The encode method returns when more\n input is required,\
            \ when there is not enough room in the output buffer, or\n when an encoding\
            \ error has occurred.  In each case a CoderResult\n object is returned\
            \ to describe the reason for termination.  An invoker can\n examine this\
            \ object and fill the input buffer, flush the output buffer, or\n attempt\
            \ to recover from an encoding error, as appropriate, and try again.\n\n\
            \ \n\n  There are two general types of encoding errors.  If the input\
            \ character\n sequence is not a legal sixteen-bit Unicode sequence then\
            \ the input is considered malformed.  If\n the input character sequence\
            \ is legal but cannot be mapped to a valid\n byte sequence in the given\
            \ charset then an unmappable character has been encountered.\n\n \n\n\
            \  How an encoding error is handled depends upon the action requested\
            \ for\n that type of error, which is described by an instance of the CodingErrorAction\
            \ class.  The possible error actions are to ignore the erroneous input,\
            \ report the error to the invoker via\n the returned CoderResult object,\
            \ or replace the erroneous input with the current value of the\n replacement\
            \ byte array.  The replacement\n\n\n is initially set to the encoder's\
            \ default replacement, which often\n (but not always) has the initial\
            \ value { (byte)'?' };\n\n\n\n\n\n its value may be changed via the replaceWith\
            \ method.\n\n  The default action for malformed-input and unmappable-character\
            \ errors\n is to report them.  The\n malformed-input error action may\
            \ be changed via the onMalformedInput method; the\n unmappable-character\
            \ action may be changed via the onUnmappableCharacter method.\n\n  This\
            \ class is designed to handle many of the details of the encoding\n process,\
            \ including the implementation of error actions.  An encoder for a\n specific\
            \ charset, which is a concrete subclass of this class, need only\n implement\
            \ the abstract encodeLoop method, which\n encapsulates the basic encoding\
            \ loop.  A subclass that maintains internal\n state should, additionally,\
            \ override the implFlush and\n implReset methods.\n\n  Instances of this\
            \ class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent\n threads."

              \ character will be\n   ignored or replaced, as requested.  \n\n \n\n\
              \ In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same encoding\n\
              \ operation then care should be taken to preserve any characters remaining\n\
              \ in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation.\n\
              \n  The endOfInput parameter advises this method as to whether\n the\
              \ invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given\n\
              \ input buffer.  If there is a possibility of providing additional input\n\
              \ then the invoker should pass false for this parameter; if there\n\
              \ is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should\n\
              \ pass true.  It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite\n common,\
              \ to pass false in one invocation and later discover that\n no further\
              \ input was actually available.  It is critical, however, that\n the\
              \ final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always\n\
              \ pass true so that any remaining unencoded input will be treated\n\
              \ as being malformed.\n\n  This method works by invoking the encodeLoop\n\
              \ method, interpreting its results, handling error conditions, and\n\
              \ reinvoking it as necessary."
