          notes: "A named mapping between sequences of sixteen-bit Unicode code units\
            \ and sequences of\n bytes.  This class defines methods for creating decoders\
            \ and encoders and\n for retrieving the various names associated with\
            \ a charset.  Instances of\n this class are immutable.\n\n  This class\
            \ also defines static methods for testing whether a particular\n charset\
            \ is supported, for locating charset instances by name, and for\n constructing\
            \ a map that contains every charset for which support is\n available in\
            \ the current Java virtual machine.  Support for new charsets can\n be\
            \ added via the service-provider interface defined in the CharsetProvider\
            \ class.\n\n  All of the methods defined in this class are safe for use\
            \ by multiple\n concurrent threads.\n\n\n Charset names\n\n  Charsets\
            \ are named by strings composed of the following characters:\n\n \n\n\
            \    The uppercase letters 'A' through 'Z'\n        ('&#92;u0041' through\
            \ '&#92;u005a'),\n\n    The lowercase letters 'a' through 'z'\n      \
            \  ('&#92;u0061' through '&#92;u007a'),\n\n    The digits '0' through\
            \ '9'\n        ('&#92;u0030' through '&#92;u0039'),\n\n    The dash character\
            \ '-'\n        ('&#92;u002d', HYPHEN-MINUS),\n\n    The plus character\
            \ '+'\n        ('&#92;u002b', PLUS SIGN),\n\n    The period character\
            \ '.'\n        ('&#92;u002e', FULL STOP),\n\n    The colon character ':'\n\
            \        ('&#92;u003a', COLON), and\n\n    The underscore character '_'\n\
            \        ('&#92;u005f', LOW LINE).\n\n \n\n A charset name must begin\
            \ with either a letter or a digit.  The empty string\n is not a legal\
            \ charset name.  Charset names are not case-sensitive; that is,\n case\
            \ is always ignored when comparing charset names.  Charset names\n generally\
            \ follow the conventions documented in RFC 2278: IANA Charset\n Registration\
            \ Procedures.\n\n  Every charset has a canonical name and may also have\
            \ one or more\n aliases.  The canonical name is returned by the name method\n\
            \ of this class.  Canonical names are, by convention, usually in upper\
            \ case.\n The aliases of a charset are returned by the aliases\n method.\n\
            \n Some charsets have an historical name that is defined for\n compatibility\
            \ with previous versions of the Java platform.  A charset's\n historical\
            \ name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases.  The\n historical\
            \ name is returned by the getEncoding() methods of the\n InputStreamReader\
            \ and OutputStreamWriter classes.\n\n  If a charset listed in the IANA\
            \ Charset\n Registry is supported by an implementation of the Java platform\
            \ then\n its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many\
            \ charsets\n are given more than one name in the registry, in which case\
            \ the registry\n identifies one of the names as MIME-preferred.  If a\
            \ charset has more\n than one registry name then its canonical name must\
            \ be the MIME-preferred\n name and the other names in the registry must\
            \ be valid aliases.  If a\n supported charset is not listed in the IANA\
            \ registry then its canonical name\n must begin with one of the strings\
            \ \"X-\" or \"x-\".\n\n  The IANA charset registry does change over time,\
            \ and so the canonical\n name and the aliases of a particular charset\
            \ may also change over time.  To\n ensure compatibility it is recommended\
            \ that no alias ever be removed from a\n charset, and that if the canonical\
            \ name of a charset is changed then its\n previous canonical name be made\
            \ into an alias.\n\n\n Standard charsets\n\n\n  Every implementation of\
            \ the Java platform is required to support the\n following standard charsets.\
            \  Consult the release documentation for your\n implementation to see\
            \ if any other charsets are supported.  The behavior\n of such optional\
            \ charsets may differ between implementations.\n\n \n Description of standard\
            \ charsets\n \n CharsetDescription\n \n \n US-ASCII\n     Seven-bit ASCII,\
            \ a.k.a. ISO646-US,\n         a.k.a. the Basic Latin block of the Unicode\
            \ character set\n ISO-8859-1  \n     ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1, a.k.a.\

            \ Format,\n         byte order identified by an optional byte-order mark\n\
            \ \n \n\n  The UTF-8 charset is specified by RFC 2279; the\n transformation\
            \ format upon which it is based is specified in\n Amendment 2 of ISO 10646-1\
            \ and is also described in the Unicode\n Standard.\n\n  The UTF-16 charsets\
            \ are specified by RFC 2781; the\n transformation formats upon which they\
            \ are based are specified in\n Amendment 1 of ISO 10646-1 and are also\
            \ described in the Unicode\n Standard.\n\n  The UTF-16 charsets use sixteen-bit\
            \ quantities and are\n therefore sensitive to byte order.  In these encodings\
            \ the byte order of a\n stream may be indicated by an initial byte-order\
            \ mark represented by\n the Unicode character '&#92;uFEFF'.  Byte-order\
            \ marks are handled\n as follows:\n\n \n\n    When decoding, the UTF-16BE\
            \ and UTF-16LE\n   charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as\
            \ a ZERO-WIDTH\n   NON-BREAKING SPACE; when encoding, they do not write\n\
            \   byte-order marks. \n\n    When decoding, the UTF-16 charset interprets\
            \ the\n   byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate\
            \ the\n   byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there\
            \ is no\n   byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order\
            \ and writes\n   a big-endian byte-order mark. \n\n \n\n In any case,\
            \ byte order marks occurring after the first element of an\n input sequence\
            \ are not omitted since the same code is used to represent\n ZERO-WIDTH\
            \ NON-BREAKING SPACE.\n\n  Every instance of the Java virtual machine\
            \ has a default charset, which\n may or may not be one of the standard\
            \ charsets.  The default charset is\n determined during virtual-machine\
            \ startup and typically depends upon the\n locale and charset being used\
            \ by the underlying operating system. \n\n  The StandardCharsets class\
            \ defines constants for each of the\n standard charsets.\n\n Terminology\n\
            \n  The name of this class is taken from the terms used in\n RFC 2278.\n\
            \ In that document a charset is defined as the combination of\n one or\
            \ more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.\n (This definition\
            \ is confusing; some other software systems define\n charset as a synonym\
            \ for coded character set.)\n\n  A coded character set is a mapping between\
            \ a set of abstract\n characters and a set of integers.  US-ASCII, ISO\
            \ 8859-1,\n JIS X 0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.\n\
            \n  Some standards have defined a character set to be simply a\n set of\
            \ abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.\n An alphabet\
            \ is an example of such a character set.  However, the subtle\n distinction\
            \ between character set and coded character set\n is rarely used in practice;\
            \ the former has become a short form for the\n latter, including in the\
            \ Java API specification.\n\n  A character-encoding scheme is a mapping\
            \ between one or more\n coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit\
            \ byte) sequences.\n UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO 2022, and EUC are examples of\n\
            \ character-encoding schemes.  Encoding schemes are often associated with\n\
            \ a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to\n\
            \ encode Unicode.  Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple\n\
            \ coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode\n characters\
            \ in a variety of Asian coded character sets.\n\n  When a coded character\
            \ set is used exclusively with a single\n character-encoding scheme then\
            \ the corresponding charset is usually\n named for the coded character\
            \ set; otherwise a charset is usually named\n for the encoding scheme\
            \ and, possibly, the locale of the coded\n character sets that it supports.\
            \  Hence US-ASCII is both the\n name of a coded character set and of the\
            \ charset that encodes it, while\n EUC-JP is the name of the charset that\
            \ encodes the\n JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212\n coded character\
            \ sets for the Japanese language.\n\n  The native character encoding of\
            \ the Java programming language is\n UTF-16.  A charset in the Java platform\
            \ therefore defines a mapping\n between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16\
            \ code units (that is, sequences\n of chars) and sequences of bytes."
