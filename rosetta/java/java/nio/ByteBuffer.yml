          notes: "A byte buffer.\n\n  This class defines six categories of operations\
            \ upon\n byte buffers:\n\n \n\n    Absolute and relative get and\n   put\
            \ methods that read and write\n   single bytes; \n\n    Absolute and relative\
            \ bulk get\n   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from\
            \ this buffer\n   into an array; \n\n    Absolute and relative bulk put\n\
            \   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from a\n   byte\
            \ array{#if[char]?,&#32;a&#32;string,} or some other byte\n   buffer into\
            \ this buffer;{#if[!byte]?&#32;and} \n\n\n\n    Absolute and relative\
            \ get\n   and put methods that read and\n   write values of other primitive\
            \ types, translating them to and from\n   sequences of bytes in a particular\
            \ byte order; \n\n    Methods for creating view buffers,\n   which allow\
            \ a byte buffer to be viewed as a buffer containing values of\n   some\
            \ other primitive type; and \n\n\n\n    A method for compacting\n   a\
            \ byte buffer.  \n\n \n\n  Byte buffers can be created either by allocation,\
            \ which allocates space for the buffer's\n\n\n\n content, or by wrapping\
            \ an\n existing byte array {#if[char]?or&#32;string} into a buffer.\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  Direct vs. non-direct buffers \n\n  A byte buffer\
            \ is either direct or non-direct.  Given a\n direct byte buffer, the Java\
            \ virtual machine will make a best effort to\n perform native I/O operations\
            \ directly upon it.  That is, it will attempt to\n avoid copying the buffer's\
            \ content to (or from) an intermediate buffer\n before (or after) each\
            \ invocation of one of the underlying operating\n system's native I/O\
            \ operations.\n\n  A direct byte buffer may be created by invoking the\
            \ allocateDirect factory method of this class.  The\n buffers returned\
            \ by this method typically have somewhat higher allocation\n and deallocation\
            \ costs than non-direct buffers.  The contents of direct\n buffers may\
            \ reside outside of the normal garbage-collected heap, and so\n their\
            \ impact upon the memory footprint of an application might not be\n obvious.\
            \  It is therefore recommended that direct buffers be allocated\n primarily\
            \ for large, long-lived buffers that are subject to the underlying\n system's\
            \ native I/O operations.  In general it is best to allocate direct\n buffers\
            \ only when they yield a measurable gain in program performance.\n\n \
            \ A direct byte buffer may also be created by mapping a region of a file\n\
            \ directly into memory.  An implementation of the Java platform may optionally\n\
            \ support the creation of direct byte buffers from native code via JNI.\
            \  If an\n instance of one of these kinds of buffers refers to an inaccessible\
            \ region\n of memory then an attempt to access that region will not change\
            \ the buffer's\n content and will cause an unspecified exception to be\
            \ thrown either at the\n time of the access or at some later time.\n\n\
            \  Whether a byte buffer is direct or non-direct may be determined by\n\
            \ invoking its isDirect method.  This method is provided so\n that explicit\
            \ buffer management can be done in performance-critical code.\n\n\n \n\
            \  Access to binary data \n\n  This class defines methods for reading\
            \ and writing values of all other\n primitive types, except boolean. \
            \ Primitive values are translated\n to (or from) sequences of bytes according\
            \ to the buffer's current byte\n order, which may be retrieved and modified\
            \ via the order\n methods.  Specific byte orders are represented by instances\
            \ of the ByteOrder class.  The initial order of a byte buffer is always\
            \ BIG_ENDIAN.\n\n  For access to heterogeneous binary data, that is, sequences\
            \ of values of\n different types, this class defines a family of absolute\
            \ and relative\n get and put methods for each type.  For 32-bit floating-point\n\
            \ values, for example, this class defines:\n\n \n float  <a href=\"#getFloat()\"\
            ><code>getFloat()</code></a>\n float  <a href=\"#getFloat(int)\"><code>getFloat(int\
            \ index)</code></a>\n  void  <a href=\"#putFloat(float)\"><code>putFloat(float\
            \ f)</code></a>\n  void  <a href=\"#putFloat(int,float)\"><code>putFloat(int\
            \ index, float f)</code></a>\n\n  Corresponding methods are defined for\
            \ the types char,\n short, int, long, and double.  The index\n parameters\
            \ of the absolute get and put methods are in terms of\n bytes rather than\
            \ of the type being read or written.\n\n \n\n  For access to homogeneous\
            \ binary data, that is, sequences of values of\n the same type, this class\
            \ defines methods that can create views of a\n given byte buffer.  A view\
            \ buffer is simply another buffer whose\n content is backed by the byte\
            \ buffer.  Changes to the byte buffer's content\n will be visible in the\
            \ view buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers'\n position, limit, and\
            \ mark values are independent.  The asFloatBuffer method, for example,\
            \ creates an instance of\n the FloatBuffer class that is backed by the\
            \ byte buffer upon which\n the method is invoked.  Corresponding view-creation\
            \ methods are defined for\n the types char, short, int, long, and double.\n\
            \n  View buffers have three important advantages over the families of\n\
            \ type-specific get and put methods described above:\n\n \n\n    A view\
            \ buffer is indexed not in terms of bytes but rather in terms\n   of the\
            \ type-specific size of its values;  \n\n    A view buffer provides relative\
            \ bulk get and put\n   methods that can transfer contiguous sequences\
            \ of values between a buffer\n   and an array or some other buffer of\
            \ the same type; and  \n\n    A view buffer is potentially much more efficient\
            \ because it will\n   be direct if, and only if, its backing byte buffer\
            \ is direct.  \n\n \n\n  The byte order of a view buffer is fixed to be\
            \ that of its byte buffer\n at the time that the view is created.  \n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Invocation chaining\
            \ \n\n\n  Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to\
            \ return are\n specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.\
            \  This allows\n method invocations to be chained.\n\n\n\n The sequence\
            \ of statements\n\n \n bb.putInt(0xCAFEBABE);\n bb.putShort(3);\n bb.putShort(45);\n\
            \n can, for example, be replaced by the single statement\n\n \n bb.putInt(0xCAFEBABE).putShort(3).putShort(45);"
