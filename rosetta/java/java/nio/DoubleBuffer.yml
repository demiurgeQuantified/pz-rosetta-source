          notes: "A double buffer.\n\n  This class defines four categories of operations\
            \ upon\n double buffers:\n\n \n\n    Absolute and relative get and\n \
            \  put methods that read and write\n   single doubles; \n\n    Absolute\
            \ and relative bulk get\n   methods that transfer contiguous sequences\
            \ of doubles from this buffer\n   into an array; and\n\n    Absolute and\
            \ relative bulk put\n   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of\
            \ doubles from a\n   double array{#if[char]?,&#32;a&#32;string,} or some\
            \ other double\n   buffer into this buffer;{#if[!byte]?&#32;and} \n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    A method for compacting\n   a double buffer.\
            \  \n\n \n\n  Double buffers can be created either by allocation, which\
            \ allocates space for the buffer's\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n content, by wrapping\
            \ an existing\n double array {#if[char]?or&#32;string} into a buffer,\
            \ or by creating a\n view of an existing byte buffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

            \ a double buffer is either direct or non-direct.  A\n double buffer created\
            \ via the wrap methods of this class will\n be non-direct.  A double buffer\
            \ created as a view of a byte buffer will\n be direct if, and only if,\
            \ the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not\n a double buffer\
            \ is direct may be determined by invoking the isDirect method.  \n\n\n\
            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Methods in this class that do not otherwise\
            \ have a value to return are\n specified to return the buffer upon which\
            \ they are invoked.  This allows\n method invocations to be chained."

              notes: The new buffer
            notes: "Creates a new double buffer whose content is a shared subsequence\
              \ of\n this buffer's content.\n\n  The content of the new buffer will\
              \ start at position index\n in this buffer, and will contain length\
              \ elements. Changes to\n this buffer's content will be visible in the\
              \ new buffer, and vice versa;\n the two buffers' position, limit, and\
              \ mark values will be independent.\n\n  The new buffer's position will\
              \ be zero, its capacity and its limit\n will be length, its mark will\
              \ be undefined, and its byte order\n will be\n\n\n\n identical to that\
              \ of this buffer.\n\n The new buffer will be direct if, and only if,\
              \ this buffer is direct,\n and it will be read-only if, and only if,\
              \ this buffer is read-only."
