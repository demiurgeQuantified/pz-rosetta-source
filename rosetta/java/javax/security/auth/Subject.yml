          notes: "A Subject represents a grouping of related information\n for a single\
            \ entity, such as a person.\n Such information includes the Subject's\
            \ identities as well as\n its security-related attributes\n (passwords\
            \ and cryptographic keys, for example).\n\n  Subjects may potentially\
            \ have multiple identities.\n Each identity is represented as a Principal\n\
            \ within the Subject.  Principals simply bind names to a\n Subject.  For\
            \ example, a Subject that happens\n to be a person, Alice, might have\
            \ two Principals:\n one which binds \"Alice Bar\", the name on her driver\
            \ license,\n to the Subject, and another which binds,\n \"999-99-9999\"\
            , the number on her student identification card,\n to the Subject.  Both\
            \ Principals refer to the same\n Subject even though each has a different\
            \ name.\n\n  A Subject may also own security-related attributes,\n which\
            \ are referred to as credentials.\n Sensitive credentials that require\
            \ special protection, such as\n private cryptographic keys, are stored\
            \ within a private credential\n Set.  Credentials intended to be shared,\
            \ such as\n public key certificates or Kerberos server tickets are stored\n\
            \ within a public credential Set.  Different permissions\n are required\
            \ to access and modify the different credential Sets.\n\n  To retrieve\
            \ all the Principals associated with a Subject,\n invoke the getPrincipals\
            \ method.  To retrieve\n all the public or private credentials belonging\
            \ to a Subject,\n invoke the getPublicCredentials method or\n getPrivateCredentials\
            \ method, respectively.\n To modify the returned Set of Principals and\
            \ credentials,\n use the methods defined in the Set class.\n For example:\n\
            \ \n      Subject subject;\n      Principal principal;\n      Object credential;\n\
            \n      // add a Principal and credential to the Subject\n      subject.getPrincipals().add(principal);\n\
            \      subject.getPublicCredentials().add(credential);\n \n\n  This Subject\
            \ class implements Serializable.\n While the Principals associated with\
            \ the Subject are serialized,\n the credentials associated with the Subject\
            \ are not.\n Note that the java.security.Principal class\n does not implement\
            \ Serializable.  Therefore all concrete\n Principal implementations associated\
            \ with Subjects\n must implement Serializable."
