          notes: "Interface describing an object capable of rendering a border\n around\
            \ the edges of a swing component.\n For examples of using borders see\n\
            \ How to Use Borders,\n a section in The Java Tutorial.\n \n In the Swing\
            \ component set, borders supercede Insets as the\n mechanism for creating\
            \ a (decorated or plain) area around the\n edge of a component.\n \n Usage\
            \ Notes:\n \n Use EmptyBorder to create a plain border (this mechanism\n\
            \     replaces its predecessor, setInsets).\n Use CompoundBorder to nest\
            \ multiple border objects, creating\n     a single, combined border.\n\
            \ Border instances are designed to be shared. Rather than creating\n \
            \    a new border object using one of border classes, use the\n     BorderFactory\
            \ methods, which produces a shared instance of the\n     common border\
            \ types.\n Additional border styles include BevelBorder, SoftBevelBorder,\n\
            \     EtchedBorder, LineBorder, TitledBorder, and MatteBorder.\n To create\
            \ a new border class, subclass AbstractBorder."
