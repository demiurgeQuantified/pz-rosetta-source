          notes: "A lightweight container used behind the scenes by\n JFrame, JDialog,\
            \ JWindow,\n JApplet, and JInternalFrame.\n For task-oriented information\
            \ on functionality provided by root panes\n see How to Use Root Panes,\n\
            \ a section in The Java Tutorial.\n\n \n The following image shows the\
            \ relationships between\n the classes that use root panes.\n \n The &quot;heavyweight&quot;\
            \ components (those that delegate to a peer, or native\n component on\
            \ the host system) are shown with a darker, heavier box. The four\n heavyweight\
            \ JFC/Swing containers (JFrame, JDialog,\n JWindow, and JApplet) are\n\
            \ shown in relation to the AWT classes they extend.\n These four components\
            \ are the\n only heavyweight containers in the Swing library. The lightweight\
            \ container\n JInternalFrame is also shown.\n All five of these JFC/Swing\
            \ containers implement the\n RootPaneContainer interface,\n and they all\
            \ delegate their operations to a\n JRootPane (shown with a little \"handle\"\
            \ on top).\n \n Note: The JComponent method getRootPane\n can be used\
            \ to obtain the JRootPane that contains\n a given component.\n \n\n \n\
            \   Example:\n   \n \n The diagram at right shows the structure of a JRootPane.\n\
            \ A JRootpane is made up of a glassPane,\n an optional menuBar, and a\
            \ contentPane.\n (The JLayeredPane manages the menuBar\n and the contentPane.)\n\
            \ The glassPane sits over the top of everything,\n where it is in a position\
            \ to intercept mouse movements.\n Since the glassPane (like the contentPane)\n\
            \ can be an arbitrary component, it is also possible to set up the\n glassPane\
            \ for drawing. Lines and images on the\n glassPane can then range\n over\
            \ the frames underneath without being limited by their boundaries.\n \n\
            \ Although the menuBar component is optional,\n the layeredPane, contentPane,\n\
            \ and glassPane always exist.\n Attempting to set them to null generates\
            \ an exception.\n \n To add components to the JRootPane (other than the\n\
            \ optional menu bar), you add the object to the contentPane\n of the JRootPane,\
            \ like this:\n \n       rootPane.getContentPane().add(child);\n \n The\
            \ same principle holds true for setting layout managers, removing\n components,\
            \ listing children, etc. All these methods are invoked on\n the contentPane\
            \ instead of on the JRootPane.\n \n Note: The default layout manager for\
            \ the contentPane is\n  a BorderLayout manager. However, the JRootPane\n\
            \  uses a custom LayoutManager.\n  So, when you want to change the layout\
            \ manager for the components you added\n  to a JRootPane, be sure to use\
            \ code like this:\n \n    rootPane.getContentPane().setLayout(new BoxLayout());\n\
            \ \n If a JMenuBar component is set on the JRootPane,\n it is positioned\
            \ along the upper edge of the frame.\n The contentPane is adjusted in\
            \ location and size to\n fill the remaining area.\n (The JMenuBar and\
            \ the contentPane are added to the\n layeredPane component at the\n JLayeredPane.FRAME_CONTENT_LAYER\
            \ layer.)\n \n The layeredPane is the parent of all children in the\n\
            \ JRootPane -- both as the direct parent of the menu and\n the grandparent\
            \ of all components added to the contentPane.\n It is an instance of JLayeredPane,\n\
            \ which provides the ability to add components at several layers.\n This\
            \ capability is very useful when working with menu popups,\n dialog boxes,\
            \ and dragging -- situations in which you need to place\n a component\
            \ on top of all other components in the pane.\n \n The glassPane sits\
            \ on top of all other components in the\n JRootPane.\n That provides a\
            \ convenient place to draw above all other components,\n and makes it\
            \ possible to intercept mouse events,\n which is useful both for dragging\
            \ and for drawing.\n Developers can use setVisible on the glassPane\n\
            \ to control when the glassPane displays over the other children.\n By\
            \ default the glassPane is not visible.\n \n The custom LayoutManager\
            \ used by JRootPane\n ensures that:\n \n The glassPane fills the entire\
            \ viewable\n     area of the JRootPane (bounds - insets).\n The layeredPane\
            \ fills the entire viewable area of the\n     JRootPane. (bounds - insets)\n\
            \ The menuBar is positioned at the upper edge of the\n     layeredPane.\n\
            \ The contentPane fills the entire viewable area,\n     minus the menuBar,\
            \ if present.\n \n Any other views in the JRootPane view hierarchy are\
            \ ignored.\n \n If you replace the LayoutManager of the JRootPane,\n you\
            \ are responsible for managing all of these views.\n So ordinarily you\
            \ will want to be sure that you\n change the layout manager for the contentPane\
            \ rather than\n for the JRootPane itself!\n \n The painting architecture\
            \ of Swing requires an opaque\n JComponent\n to exist in the containment\
            \ hierarchy above all other components. This is\n typically provided by\
            \ way of the content pane. If you replace the content\n pane, it is recommended\
            \ that you make the content pane opaque\n by way of setOpaque(true). Additionally,\
            \ if the content pane\n overrides paintComponent, it\n will need to completely\
            \ fill in the background in an opaque color in\n paintComponent.\n \n\
            \ Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more\n information see Swing's\
            \ Threading\n Policy.\n \n Warning:\n Serialized objects of this class\
