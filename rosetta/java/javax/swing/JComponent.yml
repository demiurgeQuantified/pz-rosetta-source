          notes: "The base class for all Swing components except top-level containers.\n\
            \ To use a component that inherits from JComponent,\n you must place the\
            \ component in a containment hierarchy\n whose root is a top-level Swing\
            \ container.\n Top-level Swing containers --\n such as JFrame, JDialog,\n\
            \ and JApplet --\n are specialized components\n that provide a place for\
            \ other Swing components to paint themselves.\n For an explanation of\
            \ containment hierarchies, see\n Swing Components and the Containment\
            \ Hierarchy,\n a section in The Java Tutorial.\n\n \n The JComponent class\
            \ provides:\n \n The base class for both standard and custom components\n\
            \     that use the Swing architecture.\n A \"pluggable look and feel\"\
            \ (L&F) that can be specified by the\n     programmer or (optionally)\
            \ selected by the user at runtime.\n     The look and feel for each component\
            \ is provided by a\n     UI delegate -- an object that descends from\n\
            \     ComponentUI.\n     See How\n     to Set the Look and Feel\n    \
            \ in The Java Tutorial\n     for more information.\n Comprehensive keystroke\
            \ handling.\n     See the document How to Use Key Bindings,\n     an article\
            \ in The Java Tutorial,\n     for more information.\n Support for tool\
            \ tips --\n     short descriptions that pop up when the cursor lingers\n\
            \     over a component.\n     See How\n     to Use Tool Tips\n     in\
            \ The Java Tutorial\n     for more information.\n Support for accessibility.\n\
            \     JComponent contains all of the methods in the\n     Accessible interface,\n\
            \     but it doesn't actually implement the interface.  That is the\n\
            \     responsibility of the individual classes\n     that extend JComponent.\n\
            \ Support for component-specific properties.\n     With the putClientProperty(java.lang.Object,\
            \ java.lang.Object)\n     and getClientProperty(java.lang.Object) methods,\n\
            \     you can associate name-object pairs\n     with any object that descends\
            \ from JComponent.\n An infrastructure for painting\n     that includes\
            \ double buffering and support for borders.\n     For more information\
            \ see Painting and\n How\n     to Use Borders,\n     both of which are\
            \ sections in The Java Tutorial.\n \n For more information on these subjects,\
            \ see the\n Swing package description\n and The Java Tutorial section\n\
            \ The JComponent Class.\n \n JComponent and its subclasses document default\
            \ values\n for certain properties.  For example, JTable documents the\n\
            \ default row height as 16.  Each JComponent subclass\n that has a ComponentUI\
            \ will create the\n ComponentUI as part of its constructor.  In order\n\
            \ to provide a particular look and feel each\n ComponentUI may set properties\
            \ back on the\n JComponent that created it.  For example, a custom\n look\
            \ and feel may require JTables to have a row\n height of 24. The documented\
            \ defaults are the value of a property\n BEFORE the ComponentUI has been\
            \ installed.  If you\n need a specific value for a particular property\
            \ you should\n explicitly set it.\n \n In release 1.4, the focus subsystem\
            \ was rearchitected.\n For more information, see\n \n How to Use the Focus\
            \ Subsystem,\n a section in The Java Tutorial.\n \n Warning: Swing is\
            \ not thread safe. For more\n information see Swing's Threading\n Policy.\n\
            \ \n Warning:\n Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible\
            \ with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization support is\n\
            \ appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running\n\
            \ the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage\n\
            \ of all JavaBeans\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n Please\
            \ see XMLEncoder."
