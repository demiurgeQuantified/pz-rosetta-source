          notes: "A collection of unique attributes.  This is a read-only,\n immutable\
            \ interface.  An attribute is basically a key and\n a value assigned to\
            \ the key.  The collection may represent\n something like a style run,\
            \ a logical style, etc.  These\n are generally used to describe features\
            \ that will contribute\n to some graphical representation such as a font.\
            \  The\n set of possible keys is unbounded and can be anything.\n Typically\
            \ View implementations will respond to attribute\n definitions and render\
            \ something to represent the attributes.\n \n Attributes can potentially\
            \ resolve in a hierarchy.  If a\n key doesn't resolve locally, and a resolving\
            \ parent\n exists, the key will be resolved through the parent."
