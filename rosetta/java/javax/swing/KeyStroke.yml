          notes: "A KeyStroke represents a key action on the keyboard, or equivalent\
            \ input\n device. KeyStrokes can correspond to only a press or release\
            \ of a particular\n key, just as KEY_PRESSED and KEY_RELEASED KeyEvents\
            \ do; alternately, they\n can correspond to typing a specific Java character,\
            \ just as KEY_TYPED\n KeyEvents do. In all cases, KeyStrokes can specify\
            \ modifiers (alt, shift,\n control, meta, altGraph, or a combination thereof)\
            \ which must be present during the\n action for an exact match.\n \n KeyStrokes\
            \ are used to define high-level (semantic) action events. Instead\n of\
            \ trapping every keystroke and throwing away the ones you are not\n interested\
            \ in, those keystrokes you care about automatically initiate\n actions\
            \ on the Components with which they are registered.\n \n KeyStrokes are\
            \ immutable, and are intended to be unique. Client code cannot\n create\
            \ a KeyStroke; a variant of getKeyStroke must be used\n instead. These\
            \ factory methods allow the KeyStroke implementation to cache\n and share\
            \ instances efficiently.\n \n Warning:\n Serialized objects of this class\
            \ will not be compatible with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization\
            \ support is\n appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications\
            \ running\n the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term\
            \ storage\n of all JavaBeans\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n\
            \ Please see XMLEncoder."
