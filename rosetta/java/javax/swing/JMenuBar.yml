          notes: "An implementation of a menu bar. You add JMenu objects to the\n\
            \ menu bar to construct a menu. When the user selects a JMenu\n object,\
            \ its associated JPopupMenu is displayed, allowing the\n user to select\
            \ one of the JMenuItems on it.\n \n For information and examples of using\
            \ menu bars see\n How to Use Menus,\n a section in The Java Tutorial.\n\
            \ \n Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more\n information see Swing's\
            \ Threading\n Policy.\n \n Warning:\n Serialized objects of this class\
            \ will not be compatible with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization\
            \ support is\n appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications\
            \ running\n the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term\
            \ storage\n of all JavaBeans\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n\
            \ Please see XMLEncoder.\n \n Warning:\n By default, pressing the Tab\
            \ key does not transfer focus from a \n JMenuBar which is added to a container\
            \ together with other Swing\n components, because the focusTraversalKeysEnabled\
            \ property\n of JMenuBar is set to false. To resolve this,\n you should\
            \ call the JMenuBar.setFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(true)\n method."
