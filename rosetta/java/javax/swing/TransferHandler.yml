          notes: "This class is used to handle the transfer of a Transferable\n to\
            \ and from Swing components.  The Transferable is used to\n represent\
            \ data that is exchanged via a cut, copy, or paste\n to/from a clipboard.\
            \  It is also used in drag-and-drop operations\n to represent a drag from\
            \ a component, and a drop to a component.\n Swing provides functionality\
            \ that automatically supports cut, copy,\n and paste keyboard bindings\
            \ that use the functionality provided by\n an implementation of this class.\
            \  Swing also provides functionality\n that automatically supports drag\
            \ and drop that uses the functionality\n provided by an implementation\
            \ of this class.  The Swing developer can\n concentrate on specifying\
            \ the semantics of a transfer primarily by setting\n the transferHandler\
            \ property on a Swing component.\n \n This class is implemented to provide\
            \ a default behavior of transferring\n a component property simply by\
            \ specifying the name of the property in\n the constructor.  For example,\
            \ to transfer the foreground color from\n one component to another either\
            \ via the clipboard or a drag and drop operation\n a TransferHandler can\
            \ be constructed with the string \"foreground\".  The\n built in support\
            \ will use the color returned by getForeground as the source\n of the\
            \ transfer, and setForeground for the target of a transfer.\n \n Please\
            \ see\n \n How to Use Drag and Drop and Data Transfer,\n a section in\
            \ The Java Tutorial, for more information."
