          notes: "State model for buttons.\n \n This model is used for regular buttons,\
            \ as well as check boxes\n and radio buttons, which are special kinds\
            \ of buttons. In practice,\n a button's UI takes the responsibility of\
            \ calling methods on its\n model to manage the state, as detailed below:\n\
            \ \n In simple terms, pressing and releasing the mouse over a regular\n\
            \ button triggers the button and causes and ActionEvent\n to be fired.\
            \ The same behavior can be produced via a keyboard key\n defined by the\
            \ look and feel of the button (typically the SPACE BAR).\n Pressing and\
            \ releasing this key while the button has\n focus will give the same results.\
            \ For check boxes and radio buttons, the\n mouse or keyboard equivalent\
            \ sequence just described causes the button\n to become selected.\n \n\
            \ In details, the state model for buttons works as follows\n when used\
            \ with the mouse:\n \n Pressing the mouse on top of a button makes the\
            \ model both\n armed and pressed. As long as the mouse remains down,\n\
            \ the model remains pressed, even if the mouse moves\n outside the button.\
            \ On the contrary, the model is only\n armed while the mouse remains pressed\
            \ within the bounds of\n the button (it can move in or out of the button,\
            \ but the model\n is only armed during the portion of time spent within\
            \ the button).\n A button is triggered, and an ActionEvent is fired,\n\
            \ when the mouse is released while the model is armed\n - meaning when\
            \ it is released over top of the button after the mouse\n has previously\
            \ been pressed on that button (and not already released).\n Upon mouse\
            \ release, the model becomes unarmed and unpressed.\n \n In details, the\
            \ state model for buttons works as follows\n when used with the keyboard:\n\
            \ \n Pressing the look and feel defined keyboard key while the button\n\
            \ has focus makes the model both armed and pressed. As long as this key\n\
            \ remains down, the model remains in this state. Releasing the key sets\n\
            \ the model to unarmed and unpressed, triggers the button, and causes\
            \ an\n ActionEvent to be fired."
