          notes: "ActionMap provides mappings from\n Objects\n (called keys or Action\
            \ names)\n to Actions.\n An ActionMap is usually used with an InputMap\n\
            \ to locate a particular action\n when a key is pressed. As with InputMap,\n\
            \ an ActionMap can have a parent\n that is searched for keys not defined\
            \ in the ActionMap.\n As with InputMap if you create a cycle, eg:\n \n\
            \   ActionMap am = new ActionMap();\n   ActionMap bm = new ActionMap():\n\
            \   am.setParent(bm);\n   bm.setParent(am);\n \n some of the methods will\
            \ cause a StackOverflowError to be thrown."
