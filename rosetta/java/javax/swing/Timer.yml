          notes: "Fires one or more ActionEvents at specified\n intervals. An example\
            \ use is an animation object that uses a\n Timer as the trigger for drawing\
            \ its frames.\n\n Setting up a timer\n involves creating a Timer object,\n\
            \ registering one or more action listeners on it,\n and starting the timer\
            \ using\n the start method.\n For example,\n the following code creates\
            \ and starts a timer\n that fires an action event once per second\n (as\
            \ specified by the first argument to the Timer constructor).\n The second\
            \ argument to the Timer constructor\n specifies a listener to receive\
            \ the timer's action events.\n\n\n  int delay = 1000; //milliseconds\n\
            \  ActionListener taskPerformer = new ActionListener() {\n      public\
            \ void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {\n          <em>//...Perform\
            \ a task...</em>\n      }\n  };\n  new Timer(delay, taskPerformer).start();\n\
            \n \n Timers are constructed by specifying both a delay parameter\n and\
            \ an ActionListener. The delay parameter is used\n to set both the initial\
            \ delay and the delay between event\n firing, in milliseconds. Once the\
            \ timer has been started,\n it waits for the initial delay before firing\
            \ its\n first ActionEvent to registered listeners.\n After this first\
            \ event, it continues to fire events\n every time the between-event delay\
            \ has elapsed, until it\n is stopped.\n \n After construction, the initial\
            \ delay and the between-event\n delay can be changed independently, and\
            \ additional\n ActionListeners may be added.\n \n If you want the timer\
            \ to fire only the first time and then stop,\n invoke setRepeats(false)\
            \ on the timer.\n \n Although all Timers perform their waiting\n using\
            \ a single, shared thread\n (created by the first Timer object that executes),\n\
            \ the action event handlers for Timers\n execute on another thread --\
            \ the event-dispatching thread.\n This means that the action handlers\
            \ for Timers\n can safely perform operations on Swing components.\n However,\
            \ it also means that the handlers must execute quickly\n to keep the GUI\
            \ responsive.\n\n \n In v 1.3, another Timer class was added\n to the\
            \ Java platform: java.util.Timer.\n Both it and javax.swing.Timer\n provide\
            \ the same basic functionality,\n but java.util.Timer\n is more general\
            \ and has more features.\n The javax.swing.Timer has two features\n that\
            \ can make it a little easier to use with GUIs.\n First, its event handling\
            \ metaphor is familiar to GUI programmers\n and can make dealing with\
            \ the event-dispatching thread\n a bit simpler.\n Second, its\n automatic\
            \ thread sharing means that you don't have to\n take special steps to\
            \ avoid spawning\n too many threads.\n Instead, your timer uses the same\
            \ thread\n used to make cursors blink,\n tool tips appear,\n and so on.\n\
            \n \n You can find further documentation\n and several examples of using\
            \ timers by visiting\n How to Use Timers,\n a section in The Java Tutorial.\n\
            \ \n Warning:\n Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible\
            \ with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization support is\n\
            \ appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running\n\
            \ the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage\n\
            \ of all JavaBeans\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n Please\
            \ see XMLEncoder."
