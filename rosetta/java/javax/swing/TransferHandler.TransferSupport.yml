          notes: "This class encapsulates all relevant details of a clipboard\n or\
            \ drag and drop transfer, and also allows for customizing\n aspects of\
            \ the drag and drop experience.\n \n The main purpose of this class is\
            \ to provide the information\n needed by a developer to determine the\
            \ suitability of a\n transfer or to import the data contained within.\
            \ But it also\n doubles as a controller for customizing properties during\
            \ drag\n and drop, such as whether or not to show the drop location,\n\
            \ and which drop action to use.\n \n Developers typically need not create\
            \ instances of this\n class. Instead, they are something provided by the\
            \ DnD\n implementation to certain methods in TransferHandler."
