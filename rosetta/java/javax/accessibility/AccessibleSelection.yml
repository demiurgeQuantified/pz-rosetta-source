          notes: "This AccessibleSelection interface provides the standard mechanism\n\
            \ for an assistive technology to determine what the current selected children\n\
            \ are, as well as modify the selection set. Any object that has children\
            \ that\n can be selected should support the AccessibleSelection interface.\n\
            \ Applications can determine if an object supports the\n AccessibleSelection\
            \ interface by first obtaining its\n AccessibleContext (see Accessible)\
            \ and then calling the\n AccessibleContext.getAccessibleSelection() method.\
            \ If the return value\n is not null, the object supports this interface."
