          notes: "Class AccessibleRelation describes a relation between the object\
            \ that\n implements the AccessibleRelation and one or more other objects.\
            \ The\n actual relations that an object has with other objects are defined\
            \ as an\n AccessibleRelationSet, which is a composed set of\n AccessibleRelations.\n\
            \ \n The AccessibleBundle.toDisplayString() method allows you to obtain\
            \ the localized\n string for a locale independent key from a predefined\
            \ ResourceBundle\n for the keys defined in this class.\n \n The constants\
            \ in this class present a strongly typed enumeration of common\n object\
            \ roles. If the constants in this class are not sufficient to describe\n\
            \ the role of an object, a subclass should be generated from this class\
            \ and it\n should provide constants in a similar manner."
