            \ the\n standard mechanism for an assistive technology to access that\
            \ text via its\n content, attributes, and spatial location. Applications\
            \ can determine if an\n object supports the AccessibleText interface by\
            \ first obtaining its\n AccessibleContext (see Accessible) and then calling\
            \ the\n AccessibleContext.getAccessibleText() method of\n AccessibleContext.\
            \ If the return value is not null, the\n object supports this interface."
