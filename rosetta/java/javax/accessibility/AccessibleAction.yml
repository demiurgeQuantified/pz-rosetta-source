          notes: "The AccessibleAction interface should be supported by any object\
            \ that\n can perform one or more actions. This interface provides the\
            \ standard\n mechanism for an assistive technology to determine what those\
            \ actions are as\n well as tell the object to perform them. Any object\
            \ that can be manipulated\n should support this interface. Applications\
            \ can determine if an object\n supports the AccessibleAction interface\
            \ by first obtaining its\n AccessibleContext (see Accessible) and then\
            \ calling the\n AccessibleContext.getAccessibleAction() method. If the\
            \ return value is\n not null, the object supports this interface."
