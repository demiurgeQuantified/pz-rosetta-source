          notes: "The AccessibleEditableText interface should be implemented by all\n\
            \ classes that present editable textual information on the display. Along\
            \ with\n the AccessibleText interface, this interface provides the standard\n\
            \ mechanism for an assistive technology to access that text via its content,\n\
            \ attributes, and spatial location. Applications can determine if an object\n\
            \ supports the AccessibleEditableText interface by first obtaining its\n\
            \ AccessibleContext (see Accessible) and then calling the\n AccessibleContext.getAccessibleEditableText()\
            \ method of\n AccessibleContext. If the return value is not null, the\n\
            \ object supports this interface."
