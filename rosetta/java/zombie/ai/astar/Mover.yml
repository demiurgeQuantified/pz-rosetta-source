          notes: "A tagging interface for an object representing the entity in the\
            \ game that\n is going to moving along the path. This allows us to pass\
            \ around entity/state\n information to determine whether a particular\
            \ tile is blocked, or how much\n cost to apply on a particular tile.\n\
            \n For instance, a Mover might represent a tank or plane on a game map.\
            \ Passing round\n this entity allows us to determine whether rough ground\
            \ on a map should effect\n the unit's cost for moving through the tile."
