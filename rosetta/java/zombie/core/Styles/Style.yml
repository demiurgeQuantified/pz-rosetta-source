          notes: "The default sprite renderer has various different styles of rendering,\
            \ which\n affect what data it uses from the buffer and what GL state that\
            \ it sets and\n resets before and after rendering."

            notes: "If not rendering a sprite, then we perform a build() to create\
              \ GeometryData\n Later, render() is called, with a vertex offset position\
              \ and index offset position. Return null if you are going\n to handle\
              \ your own VBOs in setupState()."
