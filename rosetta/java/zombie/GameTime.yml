              notes: Because of how Kahlua exposes static fields, when accessed from
                Lua, this will return a stale GameTime object that does not hold the
                correct game state. Lua mods should always use getGameTime() or GameTime.getInstance()
                instead of this field.

              The value can be slightly off from the true value depending on game
              settings, as it considers every 7am passing to be a 24 hour period,
              however the game does not by default start at 7am. The true number of
              hours can be calculated by subtracting (getStartTimeOfDay() - 7). However,
              the uncorrected value is still suitable as a timestamp, as the offset
              is consistent.
